# Throw

In most programming languages, when the compiler or interpreter
encounters code it doesn\'t know how to handle, it **throws** an
exception. This is how the compiler notifies the programmer that
something has gone wrong. Throwing an exception is also known as
*raising* an exception.

JavaScript gives us the ability to raise exceptions using the `throw`
statement. One reason to throw an exception is if your code is being
used in an unexpected way.

## Throw Default Error

We can throw a default Error by using the `throw` statement and passing
in a string description as a argument.

Example

::: {.replit slug="throw-example" linenos=""}
js

throw Error(\"You cannot divide by zero!\");
:::

**Console Output**

    Error: You cannot divide by zero!
    at evalmachine.<anonymous>:1:7
    at Script.runInContext (vm.js:133:20)
    at Object.runInContext (vm.js:311:6)
    at evaluate (/run_dir/repl.js:133:14)

The error text displays the error name, and it contains details about
where the error was thrown. The text `at evalmachine.<anonymous>:1:7`
indicates that the error as thrown from line 1, which we know is true
because our example only has one line of code.

Note

With all that we have learned about unit testing, you might be wondering
how you test if an error is thrown when it should be. To do so, let\'s
imagine our example above is inside a function called `checkThrow()`. We
need can then use the `toThrow()` matcher like so:

``` js
expect( function() {
   checkThrow(); 
}).toThrow(new Error('You cannot divide by zero!'));
```

## Pre-existing Error

JavaScript also gives us the power to throw a more specific type of
error.

Example

``` js
throw SyntaxError("That is the incorrect syntax");
```

**Console Output**

    SyntaxError: That is the incorrect syntax

JavaScript gives us flexibility by allowing us to raise standard library
errors and to define our own errors. We can use exceptions to allow our
program to break and provide useful information as to why something went
wrong.

## Custom Error

JavaScript will also let you define new types of Errors. You may find
this helpful in the future, however, that goes beyond the scope of this
class.
