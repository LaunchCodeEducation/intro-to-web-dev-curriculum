Errors are a part of coding. Occasionally, we make mistakes as
programmers. However, we are always trying to fix those mistakes by
reading different resources, examining a list of error messages (also
called the **stacktrace**), or asking for help.

Earlier in this course, we learned about two different types of errors:
runtime and logic. A logic error is when your program executes without
breaking, but doesn\'t behave the way you thought it would. These logic
errors usually require you to consider how you are going about solving
the issue to resolve. Runtime errors are when your program does not run
correctly, and an exception is raised.

An **exception** is a runtime error in which a name and message are
displayed to provide more information about the error.

## Exceptions and Errors

In JavaScript a runtime error and an exception are the same thing and
can be used interchangeably. This can cause confusion because a logic
error is not an exception!

## Error Object

When a runtime error, also known as an exception, is raised JavaScript
returns an `Error` object. An Error Object has two properties: a name
and a message. The name refers to the type of error that occurred, while
the message gives the user information on why that exception occurred.

JavaScript has built-in exceptions with pre-defined names and messages,
however, JavaScript also gives you the ability to create your own error
messages.

You have undoubtedly experienced various Exceptions already throughout
this class. Let\'s look at a few common Exceptions.

## Common Exceptions

JavaScript has some built-in Exceptions you may have already encountered
in this class.

One of the most common errors in JavaScript is a `SyntaxError` which is
thrown when we include a symbol JavaScript is not expecting.

::: admonition
Example

``` js
console.log("This is" an example);
```

**Console Output**

    SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list

We put our second quotation mark in the incorrect place. JavaScript does
not know what to do with the second half of our phrase and throws a
`SyntaxError` with the message: `missing ) after argument list`.
:::

A `ReferenceError` is thrown when we try to use a variable that has not
yet been defined.

::: admonition
Example

``` js
console.log(x[0]);
```

**Console Output**

    ReferenceError: x is not defined

We attempt to print out the first element in the variable x, but we
never declared x. JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError` with the message:
`x is not defined`.
:::

A `TypeError` is thrown when JavaScript expects something to be one
type, but the provided value is a different type.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
const a = "Launch";

a = "Code";
```

**Console Output**

    TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'a'
:::

In this case, we declare a constant as the string \"Launch\", and then
try to change the immutable variable to \"Code\". JavaScript throws a
`TypeError` with the message: `invalid assignment to const 'a'`.

Exceptions give us a way to provide more information on how something
went wrong. JavaScript\'s built-in Exceptions are regularly used in the
debugging process.

There are more built-in Exceptions in JavaScript, you can read more by
referencing the [MDN Errors
Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors)
or [W3Schools JavaScript
Error](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp) (scroll down to the
Error Object section).

In the next section we will learn how to raise our own exceptions using
the `throw` statement.
