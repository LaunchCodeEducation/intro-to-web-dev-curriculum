# Iterating Over Collections

One of the most common uses of a `for` loop is to carry out a task once
for each item in a collection. We have learned about two types of
collections, strings and arrays. When using a loop with a collection in
this way, we say that the loop *iterates over* the collection.

## Iterating Over Strings

The following example prints each of the characters of the string
`"LaunchCode"` on a separate line.

Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let name = "LaunchCode";

for (let i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {
   console.log(name[i]);
}
```

**Console Output**

    L
    a
    u
    n
    c
    h
    C
    o
    d
    e
:::

Since `name.length` is 10, the loop executes once each for the values of
`i` from 0 to 9. The loop body, `console.log(name[i]);`, will print
`name[i]` each time. In each case, `name[i]` is one of the characters of
`name`.

Try It!

Write a program that prints each character of your name on a different
line.

::: {.replit linenos="" slug="for-Loop-Practice-With-Strings"}
js

// create a string variable containing your name

// write a for loop that prints each character in your name on a
different line

## Iterating Over Arrays

The following example prints each of the programming languages in the
array `languages` on a separate line.

Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let languages = ["JS", "Java", "C#", "Python"];

for (let i = 0; i < languages.length; i++) {
   console.log(languages[i]);
}
```

**Console Output**

    JS
    Java
    C#
    Python
:::

Similar to the string example, this loop executes 4 times because
`languages.length` is 4. For each iteration, `languages[i]` is one of
the items in the array and the given language is printed.

::: admonition
Try It!

Write a program that prints the name of each member of your family on a
different line.

::: {.replit linenos="" slug="for-Loop-Practice-With-Arrays"}
js

// create an array variable containing the names

// write a for loop that prints each name on a different line
