# Terminating a Loop With `break`

::: index
single: ! break single: loop; termination
:::

JavaScript, like most programming languages, provides a mechanism for
terminating a loop before it would complete otherwise. The `break`
keyword, when used within a loop, will immediately terminate the
execution of any loop. Program execution then continues at the next line
of code below the loop.

Example

This loop executes 12 times, for values of `i` from 0 to 11. During the
twelfth iteration, `i` is 11 and the condition `i > 10` evaluates to
`true` for the first time and execution reaches the `break` statement.
The loop is immediately terminated at that point.

``` {.js linenos=""}
for (let i = 0; i < 42; i++) {

   // rest of loop body

   if (i > 10) {
      break;
   }

}
```
:::

The `break` statement can also be used within a `while` loop. Consider a
situation where we are searching for a particular element in an array.
(We have seen that JavaScript has array methods that can carry out array
searches, but many programming languages do not.)

We can use a `while` loop to say, *while we have not reached the end of
the array, continue iterating*. We can then include a `break` within a
conditional check to say, *when we have found the element we are
searching for, exit the loop*.

::: admonition
Example

A `while` loop can be used with `break` to search for an element in an
array.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let numbers = [ /* some numbers */ ];
let searchVal = 42;
let i = 0;

while (i < numbers.length) {
   if (numbers[i] === searchVal) {
      break;
   }
   i++;
}

if (i < numbers.length) {
   console.log("The value", searchVal, "was located at index", i);
} else {
   console.log("The value", searchVal, "is not in the array.");
}
```
:::

Notice that we use a `while` loop in this example, rather than a `for`
loop. This is because our loop variable, `i`, is used outside the loop.
When we use a `for` loop in the way we have been, the loop variable
exists only within the loop.
