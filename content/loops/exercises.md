WAIT!!! Why type \"Repetition is a good thing,\" four times when we can
code a better result? How about printing the phrase 100 times instead?

``` {.js linenos=""}
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++){
    console.log("Repetition is a good thing.");
}
```

Loops simplify repetitive tasks!

## `for` Practice

[Code it at repl.it](https://repl.it/@launchcode/ForLoopExercises)

1.  Construct `for` loops that accomplish the following tasks:

    a.  Print the numbers 0 - 20, one number per line.
    b.  Print only the ODD values from 3 - 29, one number per line.
    c.  Print the EVEN numbers 12 down to -14 in descending order, one
        number per line.
    d.  Print the numbers 50 down to 20 in descending order, but only if
        the numbers are multiples of 3.

2.  Initialize two variables to hold the string `'LaunchCode'` and the
    array `[1, 5, 'LC101', 'blue', 42]`, then construct `for` loops to
    accomplish the following tasks:

    a.  Print each element of the array to a new line.
    b.  Print each character of the string\-\--in reverse order\-\--to a
        new line.

3.  Construct a `for` loop that sorts the array
    `[2, 3, 13, 18, -5, 38, -10, 11, 0, 104]` into two new arrays:

    a.  Define an empty `evens` array to hold the even numbers and an
        `odds` array for the odd numbers.
    b.  In the loop, determine if each number is even or odd, then put
        that number into `evens` or `odds`, as appropriate.
    c.  Print the arrays to confirm the results. Print `evens` first.
        Example: `console.log(evens);`

## `while` Practice

[Code it at repl.it](https://repl.it/@launchcode/WhileLoopExercises)

Define three variables for the LaunchCode shuttle\-\--one for the
starting fuel level, another for the number of astronauts aboard, and
the third for the altitude the shuttle reaches.

4.  Construct `while` loops to do the following:
    a.  Prompt the user to enter the starting fuel level. The loop
        should continue until the user enters a positive value greater
        than 5000 but less than 30000.
    b.  Use a second loop to query the user for the number of astronauts
        (up to a maximum of 7). Validate the entry by having the loop
        continue until the user enters an integer from 1 - 7.
    c.  Use a final loop to monitor the fuel status and the altitude of
        the shuttle. Each iteration, decrease the fuel level by 100
        units for each astronaut aboard. Also, increase the altitude by
        50 kilometers. (Hint: The loop should end when there is not
        enough fuel to boost the crew another 50 km, so the fuel level
        might not reach 0).
5.  After the loops complete, output the result with the phrase,
    `The shuttle gained an altitude of ___ km.`
    1.  If the altitude is 2000 km or higher, add \"Orbit achieved!\"

    2.  Otherwise add, \"Failed to reach orbit.\"
