# The Accumulator Pattern

::: index

A **pattern** is a commonly-used approach to solve a group of similar
programming problems.

This section introduces your first pattern, which we will explore
in-depth after looking at a motivating example.

## Adding 1\...n

Let\'s write a program that adds up the integers 1\...n, where `n` is an
integer variable that we will create.

If you were to do this with pen and paper, you would write out a single
formula and compute the answer. For example, for n = 6 you would write:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6

To get the result, you would first add 1 and 2 to get 3. Then you would
add 3 and 3 to get 6. Then you would add 6 and 4 to get 10, and so on.
The final result is 21.

We can carry out this same procedure in code using a loop.

Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let n = 6;
let total = 0;

for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
   total += i;
}

console.log(total);
```

**Console Output**

    21
:::

The variable `total` is initialized to 0. The loop executes once each
for the values of `i` from 1 to 6. Each time the loop body executes, the
next value of `i` is added to `total`.

The loop carries out the same basic algorithm that we used to compute
the sum `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6` by hand. The only step that may seem
different to you is the use of the variable `total` to keep track of the
running total. When calculating the sum using pen and paper, we rarely
write down this part, keeping track of the running total in our head.
With programming, however, we must explicitly store such a value in a
variable.

single: pattern, accumulator
:::

This pattern of initializing a variable to some basic, or empty value,
and updating it within a loop is commonly referred to as the
**accumulator pattern**. We refer to the variable as the
**accumulator**. In the example above, `total` is the accumulator, and
it \"accumulates\" the individual integers one by one.

The accumulator pattern comes up regularly in programming. The key to
using it successfully is to initialize the accumulator variable before
you start the iteration. Once inside the loop, update the accumulator.

## Reversing a String {#reverse-string}

While some programming languages have a string method that will reverse
a given string, JavaScript does not. Let\'s see how we can write our own
program that reverses a string using the accumulator pattern.

We\'ll start by initializing two variables: the string we want to
reverse, and a variable that will eventually store the reversed value of
the given string.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let str = "blue";
let reversed = "";
```

Here, `reversed` is our accumulator variable. Our approach to reversing
the string will be to loop over `str`, adding each subsequent character
to the *beginning* of `reversed`, so that the first character becomes
the last, and the last character becomes the first.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let str = "blue";
let reversed = "";

for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
   reversed = str[i] + reversed;
}

console.log(reversed);
```

**Console Output**

:::

Notice that we don\'t use the `+=` operator within the loop, since
`reversed += str[i]` is the same as `reversed = reversed + str[i]`.

Let\'s break this down step-by-step. This table shows the values of each
of our variables *after* each loop iteration.

  Loop iteration             `i`           `str[i]`      `reversed`
  -------------------------- ------------- ------------- ------------
  (before first iteration)   not defined   not defined   `""`
  1                          0             `"b"`         `"b"`
  2                          1             `"l"`         `"lb"`
  3                          2             `"u"`         `"ulb"`
  4                          3             `"e"`         `"eulb"`

Try It!

What happens if you reverse the order of the assignment statement within
the `for` loop, so that `reversed = reversed + str[i];`?

## Summing an Array

Another common use of the accumulator pattern is to compute some value
using each of the elements of an array. This is similar to adding 1\...n
as we did above, with the difference being we will use the items in an
array rather than 1\...n.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let numbers = [2, -5, 13, 42];
let total = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
   total += numbers[i];
}
```
