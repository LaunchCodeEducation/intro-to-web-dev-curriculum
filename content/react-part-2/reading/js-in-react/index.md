## Adding JS into our React Project

- provide use JS functionality in react
- JSX allows JS in the markup (JSX is markup language for React - combo of html and JS)
   - you can code functions, variables, and apply the logic you learned in the JS sections
      - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-react-elements-with-jsx

### How?

- JS expressions are contained within curly braces `{ }`
- JSX becomes regular JS functions after complilation
   - meaning you can use the same logic as you would a JS function.  Use conditionals/loops inside the function, assign variables, accept arguments, and return items from the function.
