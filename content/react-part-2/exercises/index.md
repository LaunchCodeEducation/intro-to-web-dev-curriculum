## Getting Started:
Check out the [starter branch](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/react-exercises-and-studios/tree/exercises2-starter)

### Code Review
1. `App.css` is holding our CSS for the final output.  
1. `App` is returning 2 components: `Profile` and `Banner`.
1. Open the `components` directory to see what it contains.
   1. You should see the following files:
      - `Banner.js`
         - Creates a banner for the application
      - `Button.js`
         - Creates a button for the application that uses the `alert` Window method.
      - `oceans.json`
         - holds multiple objects, which we use use in our application
      - `Profile.js`
         - Will become a list template that holds an image, name, facts, and a button for each `json` object in `oceans.json`.

      These are the files we will be working with for this project.

### Part 1: `Banner.js`
1. Update the `Banner` function to return an <h1> level header that says "The Amazing Ocean" instead of "Hello World!".  
1. Apply the CSS styling for `header`.
