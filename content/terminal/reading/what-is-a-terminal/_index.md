## GUIs and CLIs

Most of the time when we use our computers, we do so through a 
**graphical user interface**, or **GUI** for short. A GUI is a system designed
with icons and visual representations of the machine's file systems.

Programmers often use another kind of interface, called the **command line**. A 
**CLI**, or command line interface, uses textual commands, rather than dragging
and dropping icons, to give the computer instructions.

The application responsible for running a CLI is called a **terminal** and the 
program interpreting the commands is called the **shell**.

The terms "command line", "terminal", and "shell" are often used interchangeably.
{{% /notice %}}

## Why use the terminal?

Both of the images above represent the same file structure. While the GUI may now 
appear more user-friendly, as you grow more familiar with the commands available,
you'll find there can be advantages to using the terminal. 

In the terminal, you will be able to:

- quickly move throughout your computer's file structure 
- make new files and directories 
- remove items from folders 
- install software
- open programs 
- run programs directly
