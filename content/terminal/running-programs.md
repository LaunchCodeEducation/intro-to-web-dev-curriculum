# Running Programs in the Terminal

Quickly navigating through our filesystems is just one benefit of using
the terminal for programmers. We can also quickly run our code inside of
the terminal to see the outputs.

The commands used to run a program in the terminal vary widely based on
type of program you want to run. However, no matter what language you
are coding in, the documentation will include, in some format, ways to
run the program in the terminal.

Example

So far, in repl.it, we have been running our programs by hitting the
\"Run\" button. If we type `node <file-name>` into our terminal, we
would be doing the same thing as the \"Run\" button!

Let\'s say there is an error in our program like an infinite loop. How
then do we get it to stop running so we can go back and fix our code?

In many cases, typing *ctrl+c* into the terminal will stop a process
that is currently running. However, if that doesn\'t work, the `exit`
command can also stop a currently running process.
