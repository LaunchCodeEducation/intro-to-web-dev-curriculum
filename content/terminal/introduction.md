# What is a terminal?

## GUIs and CLIs

Most of the time when we use our computers, we do so through a
**graphical user interface**, or **GUI** for short. A GUI is a system
designed with icons and visual representations of the machine\'s file
systems.

structure.</figcaption>

Programmers often use another kind of interface, called the **command
line**. A **CLI**, or command line interface, uses textual commands,
rather than dragging and dropping icons, to give the computer
instructions.

GUI above.</figcaption>

The application responsible for running a CLI is called a **terminal**
and the program interpreting the commands is called the **shell**.

Note

The terms \"command line\", \"terminal\", and \"shell\" are often used
interchangeably.

## Why use the terminal?

Both of the images above represent the same file structure. While the
GUI may now appear more user-friendly, as you grow more familiar with
the commands available, you\'ll find there can be advantages to using
the terminal.

In the terminal, you will be able to:

-   quickly move throughout your computer\'s file structure
-   make new files and directories
-   remove items from folders
-   install software
-   open programs
-   run programs directly
