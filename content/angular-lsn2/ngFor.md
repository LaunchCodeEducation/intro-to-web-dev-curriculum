# `ngFor`

In the
`Angular lesson 1 exercises <angular-exercises-1>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you modified a `movie-list` component to display a series
of titles. The final code within `movie-list.component.html` probably
looked something like:

``` {.html linenos=""}
<div class='movies'>
   <h3>Movies to Watch</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>{{movies[0]}}</li>
      <li>{{movies[1]}}</li>
      <li>{{movies[2]}}</li>
      <li>{{movies[3]}}</li>
   </ol>
</div>
```

`movies[0]` - `movies[3]` reference an array assigned within the
`movie-list.component.ts` file.

To change the number of movie titles displayed in the ordered list, we
could manually add or remove `li` tags, or we could use the structural
directive `ngFor` to iterate through the movie options.

## `ngFor` Syntax

The example below shows the basic approach for using `ngFor` to iterate
through the contents of an array. For a more detailed guide to using
`ngFor` and all of its variations, refer to the following resources:

1.  [Angular
    documentation](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#ngFor),
2.  [Malcoded website](https://malcoded.com/posts/angular-ngfor/).

Just like a `for` loop in JavaScript requires a specific syntax in order
to operate, loops in Angular must follow a set of rules. Let\'s explore
these rules by adding `ngFor` to our movie list code.

``` {.html+ng2 linenos=""}
<div class='movies'>
   <h3>Movies to Watch</h3>
   <ol>
      <li *ngFor = "let movie of movies">{{movie}}</li>
   </ol>
</div>
```

Some items to note:

1.  Structural directives all begin with the `*` symbol.
2.  The string `"let movie of movies"` provides the instructions for
    running the loop.
    a.  The `let` keyword declares the `movie` variable.
    b.  `of movies` sets `movie` equal to the first element of the
        `movies` array. Each iteration of the loop sets `movie` equal to
        the next title in the array.
3.  The `*ngFor` statement is placed INSIDE the `<li>` tag.
4.  `{{movie}}` is the placeholder for the current value of `movie`.

By placing the `*ngFor` statement inside the tag, the loop generates
multiple `<li></li>` elements. Each iteration adds a new list item to
the HTML code, one for each title in the `movies` array.

::: admonition
Warning

The `*ngFor` statement generates a new HTML tag for each item in the
array. *Be careful where you put the statement!* If we had added
`*ngFor = "let movie of movies"` to the `<h3>` tag, then the
`Movies To Watch` title would have been repeated multiple times.
:::

In general, the syntax for `*ngFor` is:

    *ngFor = "let variableName of arrayName"

Where `variableName` is the loop variable, and `arrayName` represents
the array to iterate through.

::: admonition
Note

`*ngFor` only operates over the contents of an array. If we want to
iterate over the characters in a string, we must first convert it into
an array.

There is a technique for iterating over the key/value pairs of an
object, but that is a more advanced topic. We will not discuss that
method here.

## Try It

From the `lesson2` folder in VSCode, open the
`examples/ngfor-practice/src/app/chores` folders and select the
`chores.component.html` file.

![](./figures/ngfor-menu.png)

The starter code should match this:

``` {.html linenos=""}
<div class='chores'>
   <h3>Chores To Do Today</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>{{chores[0]}}</li>
      <li>{{chores[1]}}</li>
      <li>{{chores[2]}}</li>
   </ul>
   <hr>
</div>
```

In the VSCode terminal window, navigate to the `ngfor-practice` folder.

``` bash
$ pwd
   angular-lc101-projects/lesson2
$ ls
   examples        exercises
$ cd examples
$ ls
   input-practice  ngfor-practice  ngif-practice
$ cd ngfor-practice
```

Once you are in the folder, enter `npm install` in the terminal. This
will add all of the Angular modules needed to run the project.

Enter `ng serve` to launch the project, then:

1.  Modify `chores.component.html` with `*ngFor` to loop over the
    `chores` array:

    a.  Replace line 4 with
        `<li *ngFor = "let chore of chores">{{chore}}</li>`.
    b.  Delete lines 5 and 6.
    c.  Save your changes.
    d.  Reload the web page to verify that all the chores are displayed.

2.  Open `chores.component.ts`. Add \"Clean bathroom\" to the `chores`
    array, then save. Reload the web page to make sure the new chore
    appears. Your output should look like this:

    ![](./figures/clean-bathroom-solution.png)

3.  Remove two chores from the array. Reload the web page to make sure
    these items disappear from the list.

4.  Return to `chores.component.html`. Use `*ngFor` within the `<div>`
    tag to loop over the `todoTitles` array:

    a.  Replace line 1 with
        `<div class='chores' *ngFor = "let title of todoTitles">`.
    b.  Replace \"Chores To Do Today\" in line 2 with a placeholder for
        `title`.
    c.  Save your changes, then reload the page. Properly done, your
        page should look something like:

    ![](./figures/chore-list-solution.png)

5.  Return to `chores.component.ts`. Add an item to the `todoTitles`
    array, then save. Check to make sure another list appears on the web
    page. Next, remove two items from the `todoTitles` array. Save and
    make sure the page reflects the changes.

### What If

1.  What if you placed the `*ngFor` statement inside the `<h3>` tag
    instead of the `<div>` tag? Try it and see what happens!
2.  What if you placed the statement inside the `<ul>` tag instead? Try
    it!

### Bonus What If

What if we want to have different chores listed for Yesterday, Today,
and Tomorrow?

![](./figures/chore-bonus-solution.png)

Accomplishing this task is OPTIONAL, but it boosts your skill level and
makes your page look better.

1.  In the `chores.component.ts` file, replace the `chores` and
    `todoTitles` arrays with the following array of *objects*:

    ``` {.JavaScript linenos=""}
    chores = [
       {title: "Yesterday's Chores", tasks: ['Empty dishwasher', 'Start LaunchCode prep work', 'Buy groceries']},
       {title: "Today's Chores", tasks: ['Load dishwasher', 'Finish LaunchCode prep work', 'Buy the groceries you forgot']},
       {title: "Tomorrow's Chores", tasks: ['Empty dishwasher AGAIN', 'Play with LaunchCode practice code', 'Groceries AGAIN']},
    ]
    ```

2.  Update line 1 in `chores.component.html` to access each *object* in
    the `chores` array:

    a.  `<div class='chores' *ngFor = 'let list of chores'>`
    b.  Each iteration, `list` will be assigned a new object with
        `title` and `tasks` properties.

3.  Update the placeholder in line 2 to access the `title` property of
    `list`.

4.  Update line 4 to loop over the `tasks` array:
    `<li *ngFor = 'let chore of list.tasks'>`.

## Check Your Understanding

The following questions refer to this code sample:

``` {.html linenos=""}
<div>
   <h3>My Pets</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>{{pet}}</li>
   </ul>
</div>
```

Assume that we have defined a `pets` array that contains 4 animals.

Question

Adding `*ngFor = 'let pet of pets'` to the `<li>` tag produces:

1.  4 headings
2.  4 unordered lists
3.  4 list items
4.  4 headings each with 4 list items
