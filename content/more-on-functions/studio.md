## Sort Numbers For Real

Recall that using the `sort` method on an array of numbers
`produced an unexpected result <sort-examples>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, since JavaScript converts the numbers to strings by
default. Let\'s fix this!

Here is one approach to sorting an array:

1.  Find the minimum value in an array,
2.  Add that value to a new array,
3.  Remove the entry from the old array,
4.  Repeat steps 1 - 3 until the numbers are all in order.

### Part A: Find the Minimum Value

Create a function with an array of numbers as its parameter. The
function should iterate through the array and return the minimum value
from the array.

*Hint*: Use what you know about `if` statements to identify and store
the smallest value within the array.

Use this sample data for testing.

``` {.js linenos=""}
[ 5, 10, 2, 42 ]
[ -2, 0, -10, -44, 5, 3, 0, 3 ]
[ 200, 5, 4, 10, 8, 5, -3.3, 4.4, 0 ]
```

### Part B: Create a New Sorted Array

Create another function with an array of numbers as its parameter.
Within this function:

a.  Define a new, empty array to hold the final sorted numbers.
b.  Use your function from the previous exercise to find the minimum
    value in the old array.
c.  Add the minimum value to the new array, and remove the minimum value
    from the old array.
d.  Repeat parts b & c until the old array is empty.
e.  Return the new sorted array.
f.  *Be sure to print the results in order to verify your code*.

Tip

*Which type of loop?*

Either a `for` or `while` loop will work inside this function, but one
IS a better choice. Consider what the function must accomplish vs. the
behavior of each type of loop. Which one best serves if the array has an
unknown length?

## More on Sorting Numbers

The sorting approach used above is an example of a *selection sort*. The
function repeatedly checks an array for the minimum value, then places
that value into a new container.

Selection sorting is NOT the most efficient way to accomplish the task,
since it requires the function to pass through the array once for each
item within the array. This takes way too much time for large arrays.

Fortunately, JavaScript has an elegant way to properly sort numbers.

## Part C: Number Sorting the Easy Way {#js-sort-numbers}

If you Google \"JavaScript sort array of numbers\" (or something
similar), many options appear, and they all give pretty much the same
result. The sites just differ in how much detail they provide when
explaining the solution.

One reference is here:
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.asp).

End result: the JavaScript syntax for numerical sorting is
`arrayName.sort(function(a, b){return a-b});`.

Here, the anonymous function determines which element is larger and
swaps the positions if necessary. This is all that `sort` needs to order
the entire array.

Using the syntax listed above:

a.  Sort each sample array in increasing order.
b.  Sort each sample array in decreasing order.
c.  Does the function alter `arrayName`?
d.  Did your sorting function from part B alter `arrayName`?

## So Why Write A Sorting Function?

Each programming language (Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, etc.) has
built-in sorting methods, so why did we ask you to build one?

It\'s kind of a programming rite of passage - design an efficient
sorting function. Also, sorting can help you land a job.

As part of a tech interview, you will probably be asked to do some
live-coding. One standard, go-to question is to sort an array WITHOUT
relying on the built in methods. Knowing how to think though a sorting
task, generate the code and then clearly explain your approach will
significantly boost your appeal to an employer.

## Bonus Mission

Refactor your sorting function from Part B to use recursion.
