# Functions as Values

::: index
function; as a value

Functions are powerful tools in any programming language, and JavaScript
uses these tools in some flexible and creative ways. This chapter
introduces a bit more of the power of functions.

## Functions Are Data

We `defined a value <def-value>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} as \"a
specific piece of data.\" Some examples are the number `42`, the string
`"LC101"`, and the array `["MO", "FL", "DC"]`. *Functions are also
values*, and while they appear to be very different from other values we
have worked with, they share many core characteristics.

data type
:::

In particular, functions have a data type, just like all other values.
Recall that a **data type** is a group of values that share
characteristics, such as strings and numbers. Strings share the
characteristics of having a length, while numbers don\'t. Numbers can be
manipulated in ways that strings cannot, via operations like division
and subtraction.

Example

The data type of the type conversion function `Number` is `function`. In
fact, all functions are of type `function`.

``` {.js linenos=""}
console.log(typeof 42);
console.log(typeof "LC101");
console.log(typeof Number);   
```

**Console Output**

:

    number
    string
    function
:::

Like other data types, functions may be assigned to variables. If we
create a function named `hello`, we can assign it to a variable with
this syntax:

``` {.js linenos=""}
function hello() {

   // function body

}

let helloFunc = hello;
```

When a variable refers to a function, we can use the variable name to
*call* the function:

``` js
helloFunc();
```

The variable `helloFunc` can be thought of as an *alias* for the
function `hello`. When we call the function `helloFunc`, JavaScript sees
that it refers to the function `hello` and calls that *specific*
function.

When we use a variable *name*, we are really using its *value*. If the
variable `course` is assigned the value `"LC101"`, then
`console.log(course)` prints `"LC101"`. When a variable holds a
function, it behaves the same way as when it holds a number or a string.
The variable *refers to* the function.

Again, *functions are values*. They can be used just like general
values. For example:

-   Functions may be assigned to variables.
-   Functions may be used in expressions, such as comparisons.
-   Functions may be converted to other data types.
-   Functions may be printed using `console.log`.
-   Functions may be passed as arguments to other functions.
-   Functions may be returned from other functions.

Some of these function behaviors do not prove to be useful. You will
probably never need to convert a function to a boolean, or ask whether a
function is greater than 5. However, other behaviors, like passing
functions as arguments and assigning them to variables, turn out to be
*extremely* useful.
