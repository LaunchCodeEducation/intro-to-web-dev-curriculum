# Why Use Anonymous Functions?

At this point, you may be asking yourself *Why am I learning anonymous
functions?* They seem strange, and their utility may not be immediately
obvious. While the opinions of programmers differ, there are two main
reasons why *we* think anonymous functions are important to understand.

## Anonymous Functions Can Be Single-Use

There are many situations in which you will need to create a function
that will only be used once. To see this, recall one of our earlier
examples.

::: admonition
Example

The anonymous function created in this example cannot be used outside of
`setTimeout`.

``` {.js linenos=""}
setTimeout(function () {
   console.log("The future is now!");
}, 5000);
```
:::

Defining an anonymous function at the same time it is passed as an
argument prevents it from being used elsewhere in the program.

Additionally, in programs that use lots of functions\-\--such as web
applications, as you will soon learn\-\--defining functions anonymously,
and directly within a function call, can reduce the number of names you
need to create.

## Anonymous Functions Are Ubiquitous in JavaScript

JavaScript programmers use anonymous functions *a lot*. Many programmers
use anonymous functions with the same gusto as that friend of yours who
puts hot sauce on *everything*.

Just because an anonymous function isn\'t needed to solve a problem
doesn\'t mean that it *shouldn\'t* be used to solve the problem.
Avoiding JavaScript code that uses anonymous functions is impossible.

Any programming problem in JavaScript can be solved *without* using
anonymous functions. Thus, the extent to which you use them in your own
code is somewhat a matter of taste. We will take the middle road
throughout the rest of this course, regularly using both anonymous and
named functions.
