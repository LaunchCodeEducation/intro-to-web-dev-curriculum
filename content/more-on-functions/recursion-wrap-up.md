# Recursion Wrap-Up

In order to function (ba-dum chhhh), recursion must fulfill four
conditions:

1.  A series of small, identical steps combine to solve a larger
    problem.
2.  A base case must be defined. When true, this simplest case halts the
    recursion.
3.  A recursive function repeatedly calls itself.
4.  Each time the recursive function is called, it must alter the
    data/variables/conditions in order to move closer to the base case.

Benefits of Recursion:

a.  Fewer lines of code required to accomplish a task,
b.  Makes code cleaner and more readable.

Drawbacks of Recursion:

a.  More abstract than using loops,
b.  Code is \"more readable\" only if the reader understands recursion.

## Recursion in a Nutshell

a.  Build a single function to break a big problem into a slightly
    smaller version of the *exact same problem*.
b.  The function repeatedly calls itself to reduce the problem into
    smaller and smaller pieces.
c.  Eventually, the function reaches a simplest case (the *base*), which
    it solves.
d.  Solving the base case sets up the solutions to all of the previous
    steps.

## Why Do I Need To Know Recursion?

If you ask veteran programmers how often they use recursion, you will
get answers ranging from \"Not since I had to do it in school,\" to
\"Very regularly.\" Some programmers avoid recursion like the plague,
while others look forward to using it wherever it fits.

Most of the recursion problems you encounter in your tech career can be
solved with loops instead. However, *recursion is a skill most
programmers will see and are expected to know*, even if they do not use
it all the time. How deep you need to dive depends entirely on the type
of job you get, your team members, and your personal preference.

Let\'s use an analogy. At some point in time, most teens must \"solve a
quadratic\" in school (e.g. find \'x\' in x ^2^ + 2x - 35 = 0). Perhaps
you fondly remember doing this yourself. As kids, we were *expected* to
know how to solve a quadratic, but as adults, the need to do this
varies. Some of us must frequently find x, while others only need to
solve one or two equations a year. Still others do not see quadratics
again until their own kids learn about them.

Since their future jobs might not require it, why do teens need to learn
how to solve quadratics? Because at some point in time they will have to
do it again (if only to shock their kids), and they need to be ready
when that happens.

The same is true for recursion.
