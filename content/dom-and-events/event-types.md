# Event Types

DOM and JavaScript can handle numerous event types. We will discuss a
few different types of events here. As you continue your studies of the
DOM and events, you may find these two reference links helpful.

## `load` Event

::: index
single: event; load
:::

The DOM includes the **load event**, which is triggered when the window,
elements, and resources have been *loaded* by the browser. Why is it
important to know when things have loaded? Remember you can\'t interact
with HTML elements in JavaScript unless they have been loaded into the
DOM.

Previously, we were moving the `<script>` element *below* any HTML
elements that we needed to reference in the DOM. Using the `load` event
on the global variable `window` is an alternative to `<script>`
placement. When the `load` event has triggered on the `window` as a
whole, we can know that all the elements are ready to be used.

::: admonition
Example

A `<script>` tag is in `<header>` and all DOM code is inside `load`
event handler.

``` {.html linenos=""}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Window Load Event</title>
   <script>
      // add load event handler to window
      window.addEventListener("load", function() {
          // put DOM code here to ensure elements have been loaded
          console.log('window loaded');

          let ring = document.getElementById("ring-button");
          ring.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
              console.log("ring ring");
          });

          let knock = document.getElementById("knock-button");
          knock.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
              console.log("knock knock");
          });
      });
   </script>
</head>
<body>
   <div id="toolbar">
      <button id="ring-button">Ring Bell</button>
      <button id="knock-button">Knock on Door</button>
   </div>
</body>
</html>
```

**Console Output** (if \"Knock on Door\" button is clicked)

    window loaded
    knock knock

## `mouseover` and `mouseout` Events

::: index
single: event; mouseover
:::

There are many mouse related DOM events. We have already used the
`click` event. Another example of a mouse event is the **mouseover
event**, which is triggered when the mouse cursor enters an element.

::: admonition
Example

We can use `mouseover` event to add a `">"` to the `innerHTML` of the
element that the mouse cursor has been moved over.

``` {.html linenos=""}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Mouseover Event</title>
   <script>
         window.addEventListener("load", function() {
            let list = document.getElementById("lane-list");
            list.addEventListener("mouseover", function (event) {
               let element = event.target;
               element.innerHTML += ">";
               console.log("target", element);
            });
         });
   </script>
</head>
<body>
   Mouseover Race
   <ul id="lane-list">
         <li>Lane 1</li>
         <li>Lane 2</li>
         <li>Lane 3</li>
   </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

**Example HTML Output** (if the mouse is moved over elements in the
list)

    Mouseover Race

       Lane 1>>>>>>>
       Lane 2>>>>>>>>>>>>
       Lane 3>>>>>>>>
:::

::: index
single: event; mouseout
:::

Similarly, there is a **mouseout event** that is triggered when the
cursor leaves a given element.

loaded into the DOM?
