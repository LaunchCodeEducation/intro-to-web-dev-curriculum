# Event Listeners

Using inline event handling is a good way to get started handling
events. A second way to handle events uses the DOM objects and methods.
Remember, the DOM is an object representation of the entire web page.
The DOM allows us to use JavaScript to configure our event handlers. The
event handling declaration will no longer be in the HTML element
attribute, but will instead be inside `<script>` tags or in an external
JavaScript file.

## Add Event Handlers in JavaScript

::: index
! listener
:::

Before we add event handlers in JavaScript, we need to learn a new
vocabulary term related to events in programming. A **listener** is
another name for an event handler. The term listener refers to the code
*listening* for the event to occur. If the code *hears* the event, then
the event is handled.

`addEventListener` is used to add an event handler, aka *listener*.
`addEventListener` is a method available on instances of `Window`,
`Document`, and `Element` classes.

``` js
anElement.addEventListener("eventName", aFunction);
```

`anElement` is a reference to a DOM element object. `"eventName"` is the
name of an event that the variable `anElement` supports. `aFunction` is
a reference to a function. To start, we are going to use a *named
function*.

::: admonition
Example

We want to set the named function `youRang` as the *click* handler for
the `button` element. Notice that the value passed in as the event name
is `"click"` instead of `"onclick"`.

``` {.html linenos=""}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Use addEventListener</title>
</head>
<body>
   <p id="main-text" class="orange" style="font-weight: bold;">
      a bunch of really valuable text...
   </p>
   <button id="ring-button">Ring Bell</button>
   <script>
      function youRang() {
         document.getElementById("main-text").innerHTML += "you rang...";
         console.log("you rang...");
      }
      // Obtain a reference to the button element
      let button = document.getElementById("ring-button");
      // Set named function youRang as the click event handler
      button.addEventListener("click", youRang);
   </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Result** (if button is clicked)

    affect on page: adds "you rang..." to <p>
    output in console: you rang...

Be sure to use the correct event name when declaring the event name. An
error will NOT be thrown if an invalid event name is given.

! jQuery
:::

This chapter uses DOM methods to add event handlers. When searching
online, you may find examples using jQuery to add event handlers, which
look like `.on("click", ...)` or `.click(...)`. **jQuery** is a
JavaScript library designed to simplify working with the DOM. jQuery\'s
popularity has declined as the DOM itself has gained features and
improved usablity.
:::

The second parameter of `addEventListener` is a function. Remember there
are many ways to declare a function in JavaScript. So far, we have
passed in named functions as the event handler. `addEventListener` will
accept any valid function as the event handler. It\'s possible, and
quite common, to pass in an *anonymous function* as the event handler.

``` {.js linenos=""}
anElement.addEventListener("eventName", function() {
   // function body of anonymous function
   // this function will be executed when the event is triggered
});
```

## Event Details

A benefit of using `addEventListener` is that an *event* parameter can
be passed to the event handler function. This event is an object
instance of the Event class, which defines methods and properties
related to events.

``` {.js linenos=""}
anElement.addEventListener("eventName", function(event) {
   console.log("event type", event.type);
   console.log("event target", event.target);
});
```

`event.type` is a string name of the event.

`event.target` is an element object that was the target of the event.

Above, we saw how we could use `addEventListener` to add the function
`youRang()` as the event handler for the `Ring Bell` button.

Using `addEventListener`, could you add the function `greetFriends()` as
the event handler for the `Greet Friends` button?

## Event Bubbling

::: index
! bubbling single: event; bubbling
:::

Remember that the DOM is a tree of elements with an `<html>` element at
the root. The tree structure of an html page is made of elements inside
of elements. That layering effect can cause some events, like *click*,
to be triggered on a series of elements. **Bubbling** refers to an event
being propagated to ancestor elements, when an event is triggered on an
element that has parent elements. Events are triggered first on the
element that is most closely affected by the event.

::: admonition
Example

We can add a *click* handler to a `<button>`, a `<div>`, and the
`<html>` element via the `document` global variable.

``` {.html linenos=""}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Event Bubbling</title>
   <style>
      #toolbar {
          padding: 20px;
          border: 1px solid black;
          background-color:darkcyan;
      }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
   <div id="toolbar">
      <button id="ring-button">Ring Bell</button>
   </div>
   <script>
      let button = document.getElementById("ring-button");
      button.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
          console.log("button clicked");
      });
      document.getElementById("toolbar").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
          console.log("toolbar clicked");
      });
      document.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
          console.log("document clicked");
      });
   </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Console Output** (if button is clicked)

    button clicked
    toolbar clicked
    document clicked
:::

In some cases, you may want to stop events from bubbling up. We can use
`event.stopPropagation()` to stop events from being sent to ancestor
elements. Handlers for parent elements will not be triggered if a child
element calls `event.stopPropagation()`.

``` {.js linenos=""}
button.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
   console.log("button clicked");
   event.stopPropagation();
});
```

With the HTML above, what happens when you click in the green?

After you see the result, try adding `stopPropagation()` to the button
click handler and seeing what happens when you click the button.
