# Template Literals

Earlier, we used *concatenation* to combine strings and variables
together in order to create specific output:

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let name = "Jack";
let currentAge = 9;

console.log("Next year, " + name + " will be " + (currentAge + 1) + ".");
```

**Console Output**

    Next year, Jack will be 10.
:::

Unfortunately, this process quickly gets tedious for any output that
depends on multiple variables. Often, concatenation requires multiple
test runs of the code in order to check for syntax errors and proper
spacing within the output. Fortunately, JavaScript offers us a better
way to accomplish this process.

**Template literals** allow for the automatic insertion of expressions
(including variables) into strings.

While normal strings are enclosed in single or double quotes (`'` or
`"`), template literals are enclosed in back-tick characters, ``[.
Within a template literal, any expression surrounded by
]{.title-ref}[\${ }]{.title-ref}\` will be evaluated, with the resulting
value included in the string.

Example

Template literals allow for variables and other expressions to be
directly included in strings.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let name = "Jack";
let currentAge = 9;

console.log(`Next year, ${name} will be ${currentAge + 1}.`);
```

**Console Output**

    Next year, Jack will be 10.

Besides allowing us to include data in strings in a cleaner, more
readable way, template literals also allow us to easily create
multi-line strings without using string concatenation or special
characters.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let poem = `The mind chases happiness.
The heart creates happiness.
The soul is happiness
And it spreads happiness
All-where.

– Sri Chinmoy`;

console.log(poem);
```

**Console Output**

    The mind chases happiness.
    The heart creates happiness.
    The soul is happiness
    And it spreads happiness
    All-where.

    – Sri Chinmoy

Note

The ECMAScript specifications define the standard for JavaScript. The
6th edition, known as ES2015, added template literals. Not only are
template literals relatively new to JavaScript, but you may encounter
environments\-\--such as older web browsers\-\--where they are not
supported.

## Check Your Understanding

::: admonition
Question

Mad Libs are games where one player asks the group to supply random
words (e.g. \"Give me a verb,\" or, \"I need a color\"). The words are
substituted into blanks within a story, which is then read for
everyone\'s amusement. In elementary school classrooms, giggles and
hilarity often ensue. TRY IT!

Refactor the following code to replace the awkward string concatenation
with template literals. Be sure to add your own choices for the
variables.

::: {.replit linenos="" slug="String-Mad-Lib"}
js

let pluralNoun = ; let name = ; let verb = ; let adjective = ; let color
= ;

console.log(\"JavaScript provides a \"+ color +\" collection of tools
--- including \" + adjective + \" syntax and \" + pluralNoun + \" ---
that allows \"+ name +\" to \"+ verb +\" with strings.\")
