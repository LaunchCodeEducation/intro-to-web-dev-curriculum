# Encoding Characters

::: index
! bit, character encoding
:::

If you had microscope powerful enough to view the data stored on a
computer\'s hard drive, or in its memory, you would see lots of 0s and
1s. Each such 0 and 1 is known as a **bit**. A bit is a unit of
measurement, like a meter or a pound. Collections of computer data are
measured in bits; every letter, image, and pixel you interact with on a
computer is represented by bits.

We work with more complex data when we program, including numbers and
strings. This section examines how such data is represented within a
computer.

## Representing Numbers

::: index
! byte
:::

::: index
pair: number; binary pair: number; decimal
:::

A **byte** is a set of 8 bits. Bytes look like 00101101 or 11110011, and
they represent a **binary number**, or a base-2 number. A binary number
is a number representation that uses only 0s and 1s. The numbers that
you are used to, which are built out of the integers 0\...9, are
**decimal numbers**, or base-10 numbers.

Since each bit can have one of two values, each byte can have one of
2^8^ = 256 different values.

It may not be obvious, but every decimal integer can be represented as a
binary integer, and vice versa. There are 256 different values a byte
may take, each of which can be used to represent a decimal integer, from
0 to 255.

Note

We will not go into binary to decimal number conversion. If you are
interested in learning more, there are
[many](https://www.csetutor.com/how-to-convert-binary-to-decimal-examples/)
[tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPvI19DmWQw)
[online](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra/algebra-alternate-number-bases/v/decimal-to-binary)
that can show you the way.
:::

In this way, the bits in a computer can be viewed as integers. If you
want to represent values greater than 255, just use more bits!

## Representing Strings

Strings are collections of characters, so if we can represent each
character as a number, then we\'ll have a way to go from a string to a
collection of bits, and back again.

### Character Encodings

::: index
pair: character; encoding
:::

Unlike the natural translation between binary and decimal numbers, there
is no natural translation between integers and characters. For example,
you might create a pairing of 0 to `a`, 1 to `b`, and so on. But what
integer should be paired with `$` or a tab? Since there is no natural
way to translate between characters and integers, computer scientists
have had to make such translations up. Such translations are called
**character encodings**.

::: index
Unicode
:::

There are many different encodings, some of which continue to evolve as
our use of data evolves. For instance, the most recent versions of the
Unicode character encoding include emoji characters, such as ðŸŒ®.

### The ASCII Encoding

::: index
ASCII
:::

Most of the characters that you are used to using\-\--including letters,
numbers, whitespace, punctuation, and symbols\-\--are part of the
**ASCII** (pronounced *ask-ee*) character encoding. This standard has
changed very little since the 1960s, and it is the foundation of all
other commonly-used encodings.

::: admonition
Note

ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, but
most programmers never remember that, so you shouldn\'t try to either.
:::

ASCII provides a standard translation of the most commonly-used
characters to one of the integers 0\...127, which means each character
can be stored in a computer using a single byte.

::: index
single: ASCII; table
:::

ASCII maps `a` to 97, `b` to 98, and so on for lowercase letters, with
`z` mapping to 122. Uppercase letters map to the values 65 through 90.
The other integers between 0 and 127 represent symbols, punctuation, and
other assorted odd characters. This scheme is called the **ASCII
table**, and rather than replicate it here, we refer you to an
[excellent one online](https://www.ascii-code.com/).

In summary, strings are stored in a computer using the following
process:

1.  Break a string into its individual characters.
2.  Use a character encoding, such as ASCII, to convert each of the
    characters to an integer.
3.  Convert each integer to a series of bits using decimal-to-binary
    integer conversion.

::: admonition
Fun Fact

JavaScript uses the UTF-16 encoding, which includes ASCII as a subset.
We will rarely need anything outside of its ASCII subset, so we will
usually talk about \"ASCII codes\" in JavaScript.
:::

## Character Encodings in JavaScript

JavaScript provides methods to convert any character into its ASCII code
and back.

The string method `charCodeAt` takes an index and returns the ASCII code
of the character at that index.

Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let nonprofit = "LaunchCode";

console.log(nonprofit.charCodeAt(0));
console.log(nonprofit.charCodeAt(1));
console.log(nonprofit.charCodeAt(2));
console.log(nonprofit.charCodeAt(3));
console.log(nonprofit.charCodeAt(4));
console.log(nonprofit.charCodeAt(5));
console.log(nonprofit.charCodeAt(6));
console.log(nonprofit.charCodeAt(7));
console.log(nonprofit.charCodeAt(8));
console.log(nonprofit.charCodeAt(9));
```

**Console Output**

    76
    97
    117
    110
    99
    104
    67
    111
    100
    101
:::

To convert an ASCII code to an actual character, use
`String.fromCharCode()`.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let codes = [76, 97, 117, 110, 99, 104, 67, 111, 100, 101];

let characters = String.fromCharCode(codes[0]) + String.fromCharCode(codes[1])
               + String.fromCharCode(codes[2]) + String.fromCharCode(codes[3])
               + String.fromCharCode(codes[4]) + String.fromCharCode(codes[5])
               + String.fromCharCode(codes[6]) + String.fromCharCode(codes[7])
               + String.fromCharCode(codes[8]) + String.fromCharCode(codes[9]);

console.log(characters);
```
