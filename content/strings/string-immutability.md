# String Immutability

::: index
pair: string; immutable
:::

If an object cannot be changed, we say that it is **immutable**. Strings
are immutable, which means we cannot change the individual characters
within a given string. While we can access individual characters using
bracket notation, attempting to change individual characters simply does
not work.

Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let nonprofit = "Launchcode";

console.log(nonprofit);
nonprofit[6] = "C";
console.log(nonprofit);
```

**Console Output**

    Launchcode
    Launchcode
:::

We attempted to change the value of the character at index 6 from `'c'`
to `'C'`, by using an assignment statement along with bracket notation
on line 4 (perhaps to align with official LaunchCode branding
guidelines). However, this change clearly did not take place. In many
programming languages strings are immutable, and while trying to change
a string in some languages results in an error, JavaScript simply
ignores our request to alter a string.

It is important to notice that immutability applies to string *values*
and not string variables.

::: admonition
Example

We can set a variable containing a string to a different value.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let nonprofit = "Launchcode";
nonprofit = "LaunchCode";

console.log(nonprofit);
```

**Console Output**

    LaunchCode
:::

In this example, the change made on line 2 is carried out. The
difference between this example and the one above is that here we are
modifying the value that the variable is storing, and not the string
itself. Using our visual analogy of a variable as a label that \"points
at\" a value, the second example has the following effect:

<figure>
<img src="figures/string-var-reassignment.png" height="300"
alt="figures/string-var-reassignment.png" />
<figcaption>When the value of a variable storing a string is changed,
the variable then points to a new value, with the old value remaining
unchanged.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Check Your Understanding

Question

Given `pet = 'cat'`, why do the statements `console.log(pet + 's');` and
`pet += 's';` NOT violate the immutability of strings?
