# Special Characters

Aside from letters, numbers, and symbols, there is another class of
characters that we will occasionally use in strings, known as **special
characters**. These characters consist of special character combinations
that all begin with a `\` (backslash). They allow us to include
characters in strings that would be difficult or impossible to include
otherwise, such as Unicode characters that are not on our keyboards,
control characters, and whitespace characters.

The most commonly-used special characters are `\n` and `\t`, which are
the newline and tab characters, respectively. They work as you would
expect.

We can also represent Unicode characters (most of which aren\'t on a
normal keyboard) using special character combinations of the form
`\uXXXX`, where the Xs are combinations referenced by the [Unicode
table](https://unicode-table.com/en/). This allows us to use character
sets other than the basic Latin characters that English is based on,
such as Greek, Cyrillic, and Arabic, as well as a wider array of
symbols.

console.log("The interrobang character, \u203d, combines ? and !");

We can also use the backslash, `\`, to include quotes within a string.
This is known as **escaping** a character.

Example

``` js
console.log("\"The dog's favorite toy is a stuffed hedgehog,\" said Chris");
```

**Console Output**

    "The dog's favorite toy is a stuffed hedgehog," said Chris
