:::

With all the different coding languages in the world, it can be
difficult to choose which one to learn first. **JavaScript** is a
programming language that has many different applications. Programmers
can use JavaScript to make websites, visualize data, and even create
art! This class will start with JavaScript for several reasons.

The main reason is that JavaScript has become a key language for web
development. Understanding how the internet works and being able to
create web applications are important skills in today\'s landscape. With
JavaScript, you can work on your own web applications and support
current applications for a company.

Another reason is that JavaScript is very much like other programming
languages. Throughout the course and your career, you will hear that
once you learn one programming language, it is easier to learn another.
Programmers have found this to be true, especially if the new language
closely matches the first.
