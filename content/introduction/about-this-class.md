## Course Activities

We have created the course activities to make the most of your time. It
is important to actively engage with each activity to maximize your
learning potential. Skipping the textbook reading or falling behind on
assignments can quickly lead to struggling to complete the course.

### Textbook Reading

Think of this textbook as your first destination in your learning
journey. In addition to reading, this text includes small questions that
can help you reinforce your understanding of the new material. Reviewing
your notes from a given chapter before moving on to the next is another
great way to make the most of your learning potential.

### Exercises

At the end of most of the textbook chapters, you will find a a page of
*Exercises*. These are small coding problems and are a chance for you to
implement what you have just learned. While exercises do not count
towards your final grade in the class, it is essential to practice in
order to reinforce your understanding of the new concepts.

### Graded Assignments

Graded assignments are larger projects where you demonstrate what you
have learned and challenge yourself. Assignments oftentimes cover
multiple lessons.
