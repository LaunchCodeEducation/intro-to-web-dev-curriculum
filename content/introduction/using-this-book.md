# Using This Book

Throughout this book, you will find a variety of different sections and
practice exercises. We are writing this guide to help you make the most
of the book.

## Concept Checks

Many pages end with a \"Check Your Understanding\" header. This section
is full of questions for you to double check that you understand the
concepts in the reading. Although your score does not count towards your
final grade in the class, you should use it to help evaluate your
understanding of the main concepts.

## Examples

Examples are times when we tie a concept we have just learned to a
potential real world application.

The label \"Try It\" signals an example that includes code you can
modify and augment to quickly reinforce what you have just read. Play
around with these!

### Repl.it

As we mention on the previous page, we expect you to use your
**Repl.it** account to practice your programming skills.

As you explore the prepared examples in this book, feel free to make
changes to the code. If you want to save your edits, click the *Fork*
button at the top of the workspace, and Repl.it will store a copy of the
code in your personal account.

## Supplemental Content

Occasionally, you will find a link to \"Booster Rockets\". While not
required reading, \"Booster Rockets\" can boost your learning.

## JavaScript in Context

Our approach is different from other ways you can learn JavaScript. The
book focuses on programming fundamentals. These fundamentals are
problem-solving and transferable concepts. While we will cover the exact
way to perform certain tasks in JavaScript, we want to remind you that
these tasks are relatively common and many programming languages have
ways to carry them out.
