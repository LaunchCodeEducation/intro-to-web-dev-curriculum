Besides this book, this class uses additional platforms for enrollment,
assignments, and grading.

## Canvas

LaunchCode monitors your progress in this class through a management system
called **Canvas**. It provides a central location to manage the flow of
information, but it does not hold the actual course content. Instead, it links
to the lessons you need, and it keeps a record of your completed assignments
and scores.

### Login to Canvas

Access Canvas and the course materials at [this link](https://launchcode.instructure.com/).
To login, use your launchcode.org username and password, which are the same ones you used to apply for this class.

### Canvas Dashboard

After logging in, you will arrive at your **dashboard**. Your Canvas dashboard displays the
LaunchCode courses you can access, upcoming due dates, and several menu items.

Clicking on a course title takes you to that class' homepage. This page shows
upcoming due dates, announcements, general information, and menu options. You
will probably use the *Syllabus* and *Assignments* options the most often.

#### Syllabus Page

The syllabus page provides general information, such as a description of the
class, the timeline for the course, a calendar, and a todo list. Scrolling
down on the page shows the *Course Summary*, which holds links to individual
tasks (reading, quizzes, assignments, etc.).

This page is a good place to answer the questions "What do I need to do next?"
and "How can I quickly find and review an old topic?".

### Assignments Page

This page sorts required tasks by date or type. We regularly add new tasks 
to this list so check back here often. Old content remains active,
allowing you to use the links for reference and review.

Clicking on a specific title brings up information about that task, including
the due date, points possible, instructions, and links.

Even though much of the course content can be accessed without logging in, the
best choice is to begin your course work from within Canvas. That way your progress gets
recorded and your scores will update smoothly as you complete quizzes. Also,
submitting files for the larger assignments should only be done through Canvas.

If you are in a part-time class, your assignments will be organized into modules for each class. The modules are locked in order so you have to work in the order of the class. Past students have reported that the system with modules have helped them stay on task and helped them more easily keep track of the structure of the class.
