As you work your way through this course you might find yourself wondering why we chose specific technologies and what job opportunities are available to someone with your newfound skillset.

Below you will find brief descriptions on the main technologies used in this course. Do not worry about understanding what each technology is used for at this very moment. This is just meant to serve as an outlook on what to expect throughout the course. You will learn more about each technology individually as you progress through the book.

### Unit 1 Technologies
