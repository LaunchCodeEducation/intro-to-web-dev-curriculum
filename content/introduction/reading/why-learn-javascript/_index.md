With all the different coding languages in the world, it can be difficult to choose which one to learn first. **JavaScript** is a programming language that has many different applications. Programmers can use JavaScript to make websites, visualize data, and even create art! This class will start with JavaScript for several reasons.

The main reason is that JavaScript has become a key language for web development. Understanding how the internet works and being able to create web applications are important skills in today's landscape. With JavaScript, you can work on your own web applications and support current applications for a company.

Another reason is that JavaScript is very much like other programming languages. Throughout the course and your career, you will hear that once you learn one programming language, it is easier to learn another. Programmers have found this to be true, especially if the new language closely matches the first.
