This page covers what to expect during in-class time for students enrolled in a LaunchCode blended learning course. Students taking an independent learning course may skip this page.

We only have a short amount of time in class to learn a lot, so using a **blended learning model** helps us make the most of our time in this course. A blended learning model incorporates in-class learning with online materials like this textbook.

## In-Class Time

In class, you join fellow students on the same learning journey as you. We encourage students to engage, interact, and encourage each other throughout the class.

In-class time is run by an instructor and teaching assistants. This dedicated staff facilitates the activities and provides support to the students.

## Large Group Time

During the large group time, the whole class participates in the lesson, led by the instructor. The lesson is not a substitute for doing the prep work before class. It's a time for us to review examples as a group and shore up concepts from the reading.

## Small Group Time

After the large group time, we break up into small groups, each led by a teaching assistant. During small group time, we do in-class coding activities called studios. This is a time to ask for individual support if you need it. It is meant to be a place where you can feel comfortable talking openly about concepts you are struggling with.
