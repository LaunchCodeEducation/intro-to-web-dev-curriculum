How many times do you use a computer in a day? What do you use it for? Maybe you use one to check email and social media, to watch TV, or to even set an alarm for the next day. Computers and technology are everywhere in our society.

With the rise of technology and computers, coding has risen as well. At its most basic level, coding is how humans communicate with computers. With code, humans tell computers to complete specific tasks and store specific information. Many would argue that due to the prevalence of computers, learning to code is vital to living in the 21st century. Writing and reading code is becoming a new form of literacy for today's world.

As our needs change, technology changes to meet them. When we needed a way to talk to each other over long distances, we got phones. As our needs to communicate changed, our phones became portable. Then, we gained the ability to use our phones to send quick written messages to each other.

The technical skills required to make the phones of 20 years ago are not the same skills required to make a phone today. A career as a technologist, specifically as a programmer, is one of lifelong learning.

Learning to code is not only valuable and challenging, it is also fun. Every *EUREKA!* moment inspires us to keep going forward and to learn new things. You may find some concepts difficult to understand at first, but these will also be the skills you take the most pride in mastering. While the journey to learning to code is long and winding, it is also rewarding.

From the moment that you write your first line of code, you are a programmer. We hope you enjoy the flight!
