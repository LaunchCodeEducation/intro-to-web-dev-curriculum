As mentioned in the terminal chapter, the essence of the command line is
text. Since this is quite different from how many may be used to using
their computers, this tutorial is meant to help you picture how your
machine is responding when you input common commands into the terminal.

Your computer is basically a file storage system. Sure, you may have many
applications installed. But where do they all live? In folders. Aka,
directories. The basics of terminal usage involve navigating these
directories.

Let's take a look at a given project opened in your VSCode editor:

.. figure:: ./figures/init_tree.png
   :alt: File tree in VSCode

   Sample file tree in VSCode

When working in the terminal, it can be helpful to think of yourself as
physically inside of the project's file system. File trees, like the one
above, are common visualization tools. Here's another map-like option
for imagining your file system:

.. figure:: ./figures/init.png
   :alt: Sample file system map

   Sample file system map

We'll navigate through and edit this sample project folder for the
remainder of this tutorial.

.. _terminal-current-dir:

Current Directory (``.``)
-------------------------

Imagining you are inside of this file system, ``.`` is a reference
to your location, or **current directory**.

Starting at the top directory, ``launchcode_courses``, ``.`` represents
your current location.

.. figure:: ./figures/locate_launchcode_courses.png
   :alt: Inside top directory

   Your current directory is ``launchcode_courses``.

Here, your terminal will look something like this:

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   computer:launchcode_courses user$


Most of what you see to the left of the command prompt symbol,
**$** will be different on your machine. The basic structure here is
``<machine_name>:<current_directory> <user_name>$``.

.. note::

   Some users choose to alter what they see before the command prompt.
   For the purposes of this tutorial, we will simply use
   ``<current_directory> $`` as the prompt.


``.`` itself is not a command. If you type only ``.`` into the terminal,
you're not really telling the machine to do anything just yet.

If you're curious, try it.

.. note::

   Most commands require you to press *Enter* when you are ready to run.


You will probably see a somewhat cryptic message, like this:

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   launchcode_courses $ .
   bash: .: filename argument required
   .: usage: . filename [arguments]
   launchcode_courses $

That's ok! Basically, we just entered an incomplete command. Our syntax
wasn't quite right. Keep reading and we'll see how to properly use ``.``.

If you move into ``lc_101``, ``.`` then refers to that directory. We'll
cover how to move locations in detail down in :ref:`terminal-cd`.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   launchcode_courses $ cd ./lc_101/
   lc_101 $

You may notice that the <current_directory> has updated but apart from
that, the computer doesn't give us much response. This is quite common
and is a reason why our file system visuals come in handy to help remind
us what we're doing.

Back in our map, we've done this:

.. figure:: ./figures/lc101_current_dir.png
   :alt: Current directory lc_101

   We're now in ``lc_101``

.. _terminal-parent-dir:

Parent Directory (``..``)
-------------------------

``..`` is a reference to your **parent directory**, aka the directory
that CONTAINS your current location.

Remember the VSCode file tree? That containment structure is represented
through indentation:

.. figure:: ./figures/init_tree.png
   :alt: File tree in VSCode

   ``launchcode_courses`` contains ``data_analysis`` and ``lc_101``.


By the end of the :ref:`terminal-current-dir`, we found ourselves inside
of ``lc_101``.

.. figure:: ./figures/lc101_current_dir.png
   :alt: Current directory lc_101

   We're still in ``lc_101``.

``launchcode_courses`` is the parent directory of both the ``lc_101`` and
``data_analysis`` directories. While we're in ``lc_101``, ``..`` refers to
``launchcode_courses``.

Moving further down into ``unit_1``,

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   lc_101 $ cd ./unit_1/
   unit_1 $

.. figure:: ./figures/unit1_current_dir.png
   :alt: unit_1 location

   We're now in ``unit_1``.

``..`` now refers to ``lc101``.
``../..`` here refers to ``launchcode_courses``.

Like ``.`` (:ref:`terminal-current-dir`), ``..`` isn't a command itself, but
rather a notation. We're now ready to tackle our first command!

.. _terminal-pwd:

``pwd`` Command
---------------

Entering the ``pwd`` command in your terminal returns your current
location, aka your **working directory**.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   unit_1 $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/lc_101/unit_1
   unit_1 $

The working directory is another term for the current directory. Think of this
command as like the 'You are here' star on our file maps.

.. figure:: ./figures/unit1_current_dir.png
   :alt: unit_1 location

   We're still in ``unit_1``.

You're basically just telling the computer to give you your current location.
This may seem basic, but this one is essential. *You need to know your current
location when working in the terminal.* A lot of beginner programmers simply
enter commands into the terminal without mind to where they are. ``pwd`` is
like a sanity check - a quick way to ensure that you know where you are and
what you're doing. It's the file system counterpart to Git's ``git status``.

.. _terminal-ls:

``ls`` Command
--------------

Entering the ``ls`` command in your terminal returns the contents of your
current directory. Recall, we're in ``unit_1``.

.. figure:: ./figures/unit1_current_dir.png
   :alt: unit_1 location

   We're still in ``unit_1``.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   unit_1 $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/lc_101/unit_1
   unit_1 $ ls
   about_me.html    hello_world.js  styles.css

All of that looks to be in order. Let's move back out into ``lc_101`` and run
``ls`` from there.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   unit_1 $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/lc_101/unit_1
   unit_1 $ ls
   about_me.html    hello_world.js  styles.css
   unit_1 $ cd ..
   lc_101 $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/lc_101
   lc_101 $ ls
   unit_1
   lc_101 $

Notice that :ref:`terminal-pwd` after we moved. Also pay attention that ``ls``
only gives us a view one level deep. Now let's talk about how we move between
directories.

.. _terminal-cd:

``cd`` Command
--------------

``cd <path_name>`` relocates you to the provided path. We've seen it before,
now let's explore this command some more.

Remember, we're inside ``lc_101``,

.. figure:: ./figures/lc101_current_dir.png
   :alt: lc101 location

   We're in ``lc_101``.


To change directories to our :ref:`terminal-parent-dir`, we run the following:

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   lc_101 $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/lc_101
   lc_101 $ cd ..
   launchcode_courses $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses
   launchcode_courses $

It's pretty self-explanatory, now we're back in ``launchcode_courses``.

.. figure:: ./figures/locate_launchcode_courses.png
   :alt: launchcode_courses location

   We're back to ``launchcode_courses``.

Not surprisingly, to go down into ``data_analysis``, we run
``cd ./data_analysis/``

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   launchcode_courses $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses
   launchcode_courses $ cd ./data_analysis/
   data_analysis $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/data_analysis
   data_analysis $

.. figure:: ./figures/locate_data_analysis.png
   :alt: inside data_analysis

   We've made it to ``data_analysis``.

Ok, so we know how to move one level above our current location (into our
parent directory) and how to move one level below our working directory. But
what if we wanted to get back to ``lc_101`` from where we are now, in
``data_analysis``?

In order to move to a directory that is contained within the same parent as our
working directory, we need to first go back up into the parent.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   data_analysis $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/data_analysis
   data_analysis $ cd lc_101
   bash: cd: lc_101: No such file or directory
   data_analysis $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/data_analysis
   data_analysis $ cd ../lc_101/
   lc_101 $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/lc_101
   lc_101 $

Do you see the faulty command? We tried running ``cd lc_101`` from inside
``data_analysis`` but the terminal did not recognize that path name from inside
the ``data_analysis`` directory.

We already know how to move to a parent directory, ``cd ..``, above we see how
we can move into a parent directory and down into one of its children all in
one command, ``cd ../lc_101/``.

Here's a visual of where we've just been

.. figure:: ./figures/cd_sibling.png
   :alt: path to a peer directory

   Path to move to a peer directory.

For practice, let's go from our current spot in ``lc_101``, down into
``final_project``.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   lc_101 $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/lc_101
   lc_101 $ cd ..
   launchcode_courses $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses
   launchcode_courses $ ls
   data_analysis    lc_101
   launchcode_courses $ cd data_analysis/
   data_analysis $ ls
   cities.sql   final_project   lakes.json
   data_analysis $ cd final_project/
   final_project $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/data_analysis/final_project
   final_project $


Above, we check our location as we navigate to make sure we know where we're
going. If we're really confident though, we can accomplish moving from
``lc_101`` to ``final_project`` all in one go. Let's say we moved back to
``lc_101`` already.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   lc_101 $ pwd
   /launchcode_courses/lc_101
   lc_101 $ cd ../data_analysis/final_project/
   final_project $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/data_analysis/final_project
   final_project $

Are you starting to see how terminal navigation can get you places
swiftly?

Let's do one more quick move for fun. To go back to ``lc_101``,
all we need to do is ``cd ../../lc_101/``.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   final_project $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/data_analysis/final_project
   final_project $ cd ../../lc_101/
   lc_101 $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/lc_101
   lc_101 $

Perhaps you noticed that the computer does not return anything to you after a
successful ``cd`` command. In the navigation samples above, we frequently rely
on the  :ref:`terminal-pwd` and the :ref:`terminal-ls` to remind us where we
are and what paths are available to us.

.. _terminal-mkdir:

``mkdir`` Command
-----------------

``mkdir <new_directory_name>`` creates a new directory *inside* your current
location.

We're in the ``lc_101`` directory.

.. figure:: ./figures/lc101_current_dir.png
   :alt: lc_101 location

   We're back in ``lc_101``.

Here, let's create a directory for Unit 2 materials.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   lc_101 $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/lc_101
   lc_101 $ ls
   unit_1
   lc_101 $ mkdir unit_2
   lc_101 $ ls
   unit_1   unit_2
   lc_101 $

Again, the computer does not return anything to you after this command and
simply responds ready to accept another prompt. But we can see from our helpful
:ref:`terminal-ls` that a new directory has been created.

And we can visualize our changes like this:

.. figure:: ./figures/new_unit2.png
   :alt: Sample file tree with a new directory

   mkdir creates a new directory

.. note::

   While ``mkdir`` creates a new directory, it does not place us into that directory.
   Additionally, we don't need to be in the parent of the newly created directory.
   We can run ``mkdir`` from anywhere within the file system, as long as we use the
   appropriate file path.


.. _terminal-rm:

``rm`` Command
--------------

``rm <item_to_remove>`` removes a given item from the file tree.

Let's say we decide we no longer need our ``cities.sql`` data. We can remove
it!

For fun - and practice! - let's remove it while we're still located in the
``lc_101`` directory.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   lc_101 $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/lc_101
   lc_101 $ rm ../data_analysis/cities.sql
   lc_101 $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/lc_101
   lc_101 $ ls ../data_analysis/
   final_project    lakes.json
   lc_101 $

See what we did there? Instead of moving into the parent directory of
``cities.sql``, we just used the longer file path relative to our location in
``lc_101``. And to check that our ``rm`` command did what we expected? Well we
also checked that right from  our spot in ``lc_101`` with ``ls`` and a longer
path.

Here's the map of what we've done:

.. figure:: ./figures/rm_cities.png
   :alt: Removing cities.sql from the tree

   ``cities.sql`` is gone!

To remove a directory entry, rather than simply a file, requires an **option**
on the command. An option is an additional character, or set of characters,
added on the end of a text command to give the computer more instructions
related to your command. Options are usually indicated with a ``-``. We'll talk
more about the presence of options in :ref:`terminal-man`.

A common method to remove a directory is to use the ``-r`` option, although
there are other choices.

Let's say we no longer want our ``unit_2`` directory. We're still in
``lc_101``.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   lc_101 $ ls
   unit_1   unit_2
   lc_101 $ rm unit_2
   rm: unit_2: is a directory
   lc_101 $ ls
   unit_1   unit_2
   lc_101 $ rm -r unit_2
   lc_101 $ ls
   unit_1
   lc_101 $


Notice that simply using ``rm`` in line 3 returns a response telling us that
the item we've asked to remove is a directory. However, using ``rm -r`` in line
7 successfully removes the ``unit_2`` directory.

Back in our map:

.. figure:: ./figures/rm_unit2.png
   :alt: Sample file tree with a directory removed

   ``unit_2`` is gone without a trace

.. _terminal-cp:

``cp`` Command
--------------

``cp <source_path> <target_path>`` copies the item at the source and puts it in
the target path. The item can be a file or whole directory and is named within
its own source path.

Take our sample file tree above. We're still in ``lc_101`` and say we want to
copy our ``lakes.json`` file and place that copy inside the ``final_project``
directory.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   lc_101 $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/lc_101
   lc_101 $ cd ../data_analysis/
   data_analysis $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/data_analysis
   data_analysis $ ls
   final_project    lakes.json
   data_analysis $ cp ./lakes.json ./final_project/
   data_analysis $ ls
   final_project    lakes.json
   data_analysis $ ls ./final_project/
   lakes.json
   data_analysis $

We didn't need to ``cd`` into ``data_analysis`` but since we are dealing with a
file contained within it, it made sense to do so. Once we ran our ``cp``
command, we checked the contents of both ``data_analysis`` and
``data_analysis/final_project`` to verify the copy was made.

And of course, now there are two ``lakes.json``.

.. figure:: ./figures/cp_lakes.png
   :alt: Copy of lakes.json

   ``lakes.json`` double take

We can think of ``cp`` as basically copy *and* paste, since the target path is
included in the command.

.. _terminal-mv:

``mv`` Command
--------------

``mv <item_to_move> <target_path>`` moves an item to the provided target path.
The item being moved can be a single file or a whole directory. When referring
to the item being moved, its source path is required, just like the
:ref:`terminal-cp`.

Still in ``data_analysis``, lets move ``data_analysis/lakes.json`` into
``lc_101``.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   data_analysis $ mv ./lakes.json ../lc_101/
   data_analysis $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/data_analysis
   data_analysis $ ls
   final_project
   data_analysis $ ls ../lc_101/
   lakes.json   unit_1
   data_analysis $

As usual, we use ``ls`` to verify our results. Now our map looks like the
following:

.. figure:: ./figures/mv_lakes.png
   :alt: Moving lakes.json to lc101

   ``mv`` moves one of the ``lakes.json``.

.. _terminal-touch:

``touch`` Command
-----------------

``touch <new_file_name>`` creates a new file.

Back in ``data_analysis``, lets add a new ``cafes.json`` file to our directory.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   data_analysis $ pwd
   launchcode_courses/data_analysis
   data_analysis $ ls
   final_project
   data_analysis $ touch cafes.json
   data_analysis $ ls
   cafes.json    final_project
   data_analysis $

Here's what that gives us:

.. figure:: ./figures/touch_cafes.png
   :alt: A new file

   ``touch`` adds a file

.. _terminal-clear:

``clear`` Command
-----------------

``clear`` wipes your terminal window of any previously run commands
and outputs in case you need a clean screen to think straight.

You probably won't encounter a scenario where you *need* to clear your
terminal, but it can be a nice command to know if you're a minimalist.

There's no change to our file map to show when this command is run. And in the
terminal window, as soon as enter is hit, the command results in what looks
like a new window.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   data_analysis $

.. _terminal-man:

``man`` Command
---------------

``man`` is your best friend. Running ``man <command>`` gives you a manual
entry of what that command does, what options it takes, and more
documentation than you could ever need. It's so thorough, it makes this
guide blush. Any command you think you may need, but you're not sure how
to use it, or maybe you want to do something specific and are wondering if
there's a specialized option for it, use ``man`` to get more info!

Practice looking up some of the commands you know; maybe you'll learn a
new option or two!

Some other terminal stuff you should know when using the manual:

#. Scrolling: Some entries are very long! They will probably need to be
   scrolled through. You'll know there's more to read if you see ``:`` at the
   bottom of your terminal window. You can use your keyboard's arrow keys to
   navigate the entry. If you reach the bottom of the entry,
   you'll see a line that reads ``END``.

#. Exiting: Once you're finished reading, you'll need to exit the manual page
   using the :ref:`terminal-q` command.

.. _terminal-exiting-programs:

Exiting Programs
----------------

.. _terminal-ctrlc:

``ctrl + c`` Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*ctrl + c* can be used to exit a running program.

Some programs take different commands to exit. *ctrl + c* is sometimes the
command to quit a running program and other times used to prompt the running
program for an different exit command.

.. _terminal-q:

``q``
^^^^^

``q`` is another command for exiting a running program. Notably, it is needed
to exit the :ref:`terminal-man` pages.
