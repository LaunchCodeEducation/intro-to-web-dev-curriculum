# Unit Testing in Action

:::

Testing is a bit of an art; there are no hard and fast rules about how
to go about writing good tests. That said, there are some general
principles that you should follow. In this section, we explore some of
these.

In particular, we focus on identifying good **test cases** by working
through a specific example. A test case is a single situation that is
being tested.

## What to Test

When writing tests for your code, what should you test? You can\'t test
*every* possible situation or input. But you also don\'t want to leave
out important cases. A function or program that isn\'t well-tested might
have bugs lurking beneath the surface.

::: note

Note
:::

Since we are focused on *unit* testing, in this chapter we will
generally use the term \"unit\" to refer to the function or program
under consideration.
:::

Regardless of the situation, there are three types of test cases that
you should consider: positive, negative, and edge cases.

1.  A **positive test** verifies expected behavior with valid data.
2.  A **negative test** verifies expected behavior with *invalid* data.
3.  An **edge case** is a subset of positive tests, which checks the
    extreme edges of valid values.

::: admonition
Example

Imagine a function named `setTemperature` that accepts a number between
`50` and `100`.

1.  Positive test values: `56`, `75`, `80`
2.  Negative test values: `-1`, `101`, `"70"`
3.  Edge case values: `50`, `100`
:::

Considering positive, negative, and edge tests will go a long way toward
helping you create well-tested code.

Let\'s see these in action, by writing tests for
`our isPalindrome function <palindrome-function>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Setting Up

Here\'s the function we want to test:

::: {.replit linenos="" slug="isPalindrome"}
js

function reverse(str) {

:   return str.split(\'\').reverse().join(\'\');

}

function isPalindrome(str) {

:   return reverse(str) === str;

}
:::

::: {#export-set-up}
Code along with us by forking [our repl.it starter code
project](https://repl.it/@launchcode/isPalindrome-With-Tests-Starter),
which includes the above code in `palindrome.js` and the Jasmine test
runner code in `index.js`. Note that we have removed the `console.log`
statements from the original code and exported the `isPalindrome`
function:
:::

``` js
module.exports = isPalindrome;
```

::: admonition
Tip

When creating a unit-tested project, *always* start by copying the
Jasmine test runner code into `index.js` and putting the code you want
to test in an appropriately named `.js` file.
:::

You have become used to testing your code by running it and printing
output with `console.log`. When writing unit-tested code, we no longer
need to take this approach.

::: admonition
Tip

If you find yourself tempted to add a `console.log` statement to your
code, write a unit test instead! You would mostly likely remove that
`console.log` after getting your code to work, while the test will
remain for you and other developers to use in the future.
:::

::: {#set-up}
Finally, create `spec/` folder and add a spec file,
`palindrome.spec.js`. This file should include imports and a describe
block:
:::

``` {.js linenos=""}
const isPalindrome = require('../palindrome.js');

describe("isPalindrome", function(){

   // TODO - write some tests!

});
```

Okay, let\'s write some tests!

## Positive and Negative Test Cases

### Positive Test Cases

We\'ll start with positive and negative tests. For `isPalindrome`, some
positive tests have inputs:

-   `"a"`
-   `"aaaa"`
-   `"aba"`
-   `"racecar"`

Calling `isPalindrome` with these inputs should return `true` in each
case. Notice that these tests are as simple as possible. Keeping test
inputs simple, while still covering your desired test cases, will make
it easier to fix a bug in the event that a unit test fails.

Let\'s add tests for these inputs to `spec/palindrome.spec.js`:

``` {.js linenos=""}
const isPalindrome = require('../palindrome.js');

describe("isPalindrome", function(){

   it("should return true for a single letter", function(){
      expect(isPalindrome("a")).toBeTrue();
   });

   it("should return true for a single letter repeated", function(){
      expect(isPalindrome("aaa")).toBeTrue();
   });

   it("should return true for a simple palindrome", function(){
      expect(isPalindrome("aba")).toBeTrue();
   });

   it("should return true for a longer palindrome", function(){
      expect(isPalindrome("racecar")).toBeTrue();
   });

});
```

Note the clear test case descriptions (for example, \"should return true
for a single letter repeated\"), which will help us easily identify the
expected behavior of our code later.

After adding the positive tests to your file, run them to make sure they
all pass.

### Negative Test Cases

For `isPalindrome`, some negative tests have inputs:

-   `"ab"`
-   `"launchcode"`
-   `"abA"`
-   `"so many dynamos"`

Calling `isPalindrome` with these inputs should return `false` in each
case. The last two of these negative tests deserve a bit more
discussion.

When writing our `isPalindrome` function initially, we made two
important decisions:

-   Case should be considered, and
-   whitespace should be considered.

The definition of a palindrome differs sometimes on these two matters,
so it\'s important to test them.

Testing with input `"abA"`[ ensures that case is considered, since the
lowercase version of this string, ]{.title-ref}[\"aba\"]{.title-ref}[,
\*is\* a palindrome. Testing with ]{.title-ref}[\"so many
dynamos\"]{.title-ref}[ ensures that whitespace is considered, since the
version of this string with whitespace removed,
]{.title-ref}[\"somanydynamos\"]{.title-ref}\`, *is* a palindrome.

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

It\'s important to isolate your test cases. For example,
`"So Many Dynamos"` is a poor choice of input for a negative test, since
it contains *two* characteristics that are being tested for - case and
whitespace. If a test with this input failed, it would NOT be clear why
it failed.
:::

Including specific tests that demonstrate how *our* `isPalindrome`
function behaves in these situations helps make our code
*self-documenting*. Someone can read our tests and easily see that we
*do* consider case and whitespace.

Let\'s add some test for these negative cases. Add these within the
`describe` call.

``` {.js linenos=""}
it("should return false for a longer non-palindrome", function(){
   expect(isPalindrome("launchcode")).toBeFalse();
});

it("should return false for a simple non-palindrome", function(){
   expect(isPalindrome("ab")).toBeFalse();
});

it("should be case-sensitive", function(){
   expect(isPalindrome("abA")).toBeFalse();
});

it("should consider whitespace", function(){
   expect(isPalindrome("so many dynamos")).toBeFalse();
});
```

Now run the tests to make sure they pass. Your code now includes a set
of tests that considers a wide variety of positive and negative cases.

## Edge Cases

Recall our definition of **edge case**:

> An edge case is a test case that provides input at the extreme edge of
> what the unit should be able to handle.

Edge cases can look very different for different units of code. Most of
the examples we provided above dealt with numerical edge cases. However,
edge cases can also be non-numeric.

In the case of `isPalindrome`, the most obvious edge case would be that
of the empty string, `""`. This is the smallest possible string that we
can use when calling `isPalindrome`. Not only is it the smallest, but it
is essentially *different* from the next longest string, `"a"`\-\--one
has characters and one doesn\'t.

Should the empty string be considered a palindrome? That decision is up
to us, the programmer, and there is no right or wrong answer. In our
case, we decided to take a very literal definition of the term
\"palindrome\" by considering case and whitespace. In other words, our
definition says that a string is a palindrome exactly when it equals its
reverse. Since the reverse of `""` is also `""`, it makes sense to
consider the empty string a palindrome.

Let\'s add this test case to our spec:

``` js
it("should consider the empty string a palindrome", function(){
   expect(isPalindrome("")).toBeTrue();
});
```

Now run the tests, which should all pass.

You might think that another edge case is that of the longest possible
palindrome. Such a palindrome would be as long as the longest possible
string in JavaScript. This case is not worth considering for a couple of
reasons:

-   The length of the longest string [can vary across different
    JavaScript
    implementations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length#Description).
-   The most recent JavaScript specification, ES2016, states that the
    maximum allowed length of a string should be 2 ^53^ - 1 characters.
    This is a LOT of characters, and it is unrealistic to expect that
    our function will ever be given such a string.

## Toward a Better Testing Workflow

In this case, we had a well-written function to write tests for, so it
was straightforward to create tests that pass. Most situations will not
be this simple. Your tests will often uncover bugs, forcing you to go
back and update your code. That\'s okay! This is precisely what tests
are for.

The workflow for this situation is:

1.  Write code
2.  Write tests
3.  Fix any bugs found while testing

The rest of the chapter focuses on a programming technique that allows
you to completely *eliminate* the third step, by reversing the order of
the first two:

1.  Write tests
2.  Write code

As you will soon learn, writing your tests *before* the code is a great
way to enhance your programming efficiency and quality.

## Check Your Understanding

Let\'s assume we updated `isPalindrome` to be case-insensitive (e.g.
`isPalindrome('Radar')` returns `true`).
