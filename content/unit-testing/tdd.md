Now that we know more about unit tests, we are going to learn a new way
of using them. So far we have written tests to verify functionality of
*existing* code. Next we are going to use tests to verify functionality
of code that does NOT already exist. This may sound odd, but this
process has many benefits as we will learn.

As the name sounds, **Test-driven development (TDD)** is a software
development process where the unit tests are written first. However,
that doesn\'t tell the entire story. Writing the tests first and
intentionally thinking more about the code design leads to better code.
The name comes from the idea of the tests *driving* the development
process.

Before we can start using TDD, we need a list of discrete features that
can be turned into unit tests. This will help keep our tests focused on
specific functionality which should lead to code that is easy to read.
Along the way we will build confidence as we add features.

Note

TDD is a process that some organizations choose to use. Using the TDD
process is not required when using unit tests.

## The Test/Code Cycle {#test-code-cycle}

With TDD you start with the unit test first. Each test must *clearly
describe* the behavior it is testing.

::: admonition
Example

Example test case for a data parsing project:

-   Take in a string of numbers delimited by a character and return an
    array.
:::

Because the test is for a feature that does NOT exist *yet*, we need to
think about how the feature will be implemented. This is the time to ask
questions like: *Should we add a new parameter? What about an entirely
new function? What will the function return?*

::: admonition
Example

How could we implement our test case? Remember we aren\'t writing the
code yet, only thinking about the design.

-   The test case will evaluate the function named `parseData`
-   The `parseData` function will:
    -   contain a `data` parameter that gets assigned a string of data
    -   contain a `delimiter` parameter that will be used to split the
        string into an array
    -   return an array
-   `parseData` will be defined in a module
:::

Next, write the unit test as if the parameter or function you imagined
already exists. This may seem a bit odd, but considering how the new
code will be used helps find bugs and flaws earlier. We also have to use
test utilities such as `expect().toEqual()` to clearly demonstrate that
the proposed new code functions properly.

::: admonition
Example

Next, type out the ideas into an actual test. In this example, the test
references a module and a function that have not been created yet. The
code follows the plan we came up with earlier. Very importantly, there
is an `expect().toBeTrue()` that verifies an array is returned.

``` {.js linenos=""}
const parse = require('../parse-numbers');

describe("parse numbers", function(){

   it("returns array when passed comma separated list of numbers", function(){
      let items = parse("5,8,0,17,6,4,9,3", ",");
      expect(Array.isArray(items)).toBeTrue();
   });

});
```
:::

Now run the test! The test should fail (or not compile at all) because
you have referenced code that does not exist yet.

Finally, write code to pass the new test. In the earlier chapters, this
is where you started, but with TDD writing new code is the *last* step.

::: admonition
Example

To make the new test pass, a file must be created that exports a
`parseData` function with logic that satisfies the expected result.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function parseData(text, delimiter) {
   return text.split(delimiter);
}

module.exports = parseData;
```
:::

Coding this way builds confidence in your work. No matter how large your
code base may get, you know that each part has a test to validate its
functionality.

::: admonition
Example

Now that we have one passing test for our data parser project, we could
confidently move on to writing tests and code for the remaining
features.

## Red, Green, Refactor

While adding new features and making our code work is the main goal, we
also want to write readable, efficient code that makes us proud. The
**red, green, refactor** mantra describes the process of writing tests,
seeing them pass, and then making the code better. As the name suggests,
the cycle consists of three steps. Red refers to test results that fail,
while green represents tests that pass. The colors refer to test results
which are often styled with red for failing tests and green for passing
tests.

1.  Red -\> Write a failing test.

2.  Green -\> Make it pass by implementing the code.

3.  Refactor -\> Make the code better.

**Refactoring code** means to keep the same overall feature, but change
how that feature is implemented. Since we have a test to verify our
code, we can change the code with confidence, knowing that any error
will be immediately identified by the test. Here are a few examples of
refactoring:

1.  Using different data structures,
2.  Reducing the number of times needed to loop through an array,
3.  Moving duplicate logic into a function so it can be reused.

The refactor is also done in a TDD process:

1.  Decide how to improve the implementation of the feature,
2.  Change the unit test to use this new idea,
3.  Run the code to see the test fail,
4.  Refactor the code to implement the new idea,
5.  Finally, see the test pass with the refactored design.
