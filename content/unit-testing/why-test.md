# Why Test Your Code?

Checking your code is part of the development process. Developers rarely
write code without verifying it. You are used to debugging programs as
you write them. In fact, we devoted an entire chapter to
`debugging <errors-and-debugging>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} early
in the course.

Your development process probably looks something like this:

1.  Write code
2.  Run program
3.  Notice error and investigate
4.  Repeat these steps until there are no more errors

But there\'s a better way to test your code, using *automated* tests.
Automated tests actively test your code and help to remove the burden of
manual testing. There are many types of automated tests. This chapter
focuses on **unit testing**, which tests the smallest components (or
*units*) of code. These are typically individual functions.

Before we dive into the *how* of unit testing, let\'s discuss the *why*.

## Know Your Code *Really* Works

Manual testing can eventually lead you to a complete, error-free
program. Unit testing provides a better alternative.

This might sound familiar:

> You write a program and manually test it. Thinking it is complete, you
> turn it in only to find that it has a bug or use case that you didn\'t
> consider.

The unit testing process helps avoid this by starting with a list of
specific, clearly stated behaviors that the program should satisfy. The
behaviors are then converted into automated tests that demonstrate
program behavior and provide a framework for writing code that *really*
works.

## Find Regressions

What about this situation?

> You write feature #1 for a program. You then move on to feature #2.
> After finishing feature #2, you realize that your changes broke
> feature #1.

This is frustrating, right? Especially with larger programs, adding new
features often causes unexpected problems in other parts of the code,
potentially breaking the entire program. The introduction of such a bug
is known as a **regression**.

If you have a collection of tests that can run quickly and consistently,
you will know *right away* when a regression appears in your program.
This allows you to identify and fix it more quickly.

## Tests as Documentation

::: index
! self-documenting code

One of the most powerful aspects of unit testing is that it allows us to
clearly define program expectations. A good collection of unit tests can
function as a set of *statements* about *how* the program should behave.
You and others can read the tests and quickly get an idea of the
specifics of program behavior.

Example

Your coworker gives you a function that validates phone numbers, but
doesn\'t provide much detail. Does it handle country codes? Does it
require an area code? Does it allow parentheses around area codes? These
details would be easily understood if the function had a collection of
unit tests that described its behavior.
:::

Code with a good, descriptive set of unit tests is sometimes called
**self-documenting code**.

Remembering what your code does and why you structured it a certain way
is easy for small programs. However, as the number of your projects
increase and their size grows, the need for documentation becomes
critical.

Documentation can be in the form of code comments or external text
documents. These can be helpful, but have one major drawback which is
that they can get out of date very quickly. Out dated, incorrect
documentation is very frustrating for a user.

Properly designed unit tests are runnable documentation for your
project. Because unit tests are runnable code that declares and verifies
features, they can NEVER get out of sync with the updated code. If a
feature is added or removed, the tests must be updated in order to make
them pass.

Let\'s go ahead and write our first unit test!
