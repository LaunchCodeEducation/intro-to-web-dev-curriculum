# TDD in Action

[Fork our starter code
repl.it](https://repl.it/@launchcode/Transmission-processor-TDD-starter-Expectations)
and follow along as we implement a project using TDD.

We need to write a Node module to process transmissions from the
[Voyager1 probe](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/).

Example

Transmission

``` js
"1410::<932829840830053761>"
```

Expected Result

``` js
{
   id: 1410,
   rawData: 932829840830053761
}
```

## Requirements

The features for this project have already been broken down into small
testable units. Let\'s review them and then we will take it slow, one
step at a time.

1.  Take in a transmission string and return an object.
2.  Return `-1` if the transmission does NOT contain `"::"`.
3.  Returned object should contain an `id` property
    -   The value of `id` is the part of the transmission *before* the
        `"::"`
4.  The `id` property should be of type `Number`
5.  Returned object should contain a `rawData` property
    -   The value of `rawData` is the part of the transmission *after*
        the `"::"`
6.  Return -1 for the value `rawData` if the `rawData` part of the
    transmission does NOT start with `<` and end with `>`

## Requirement #1

*Requirement:* Take in a transmission string and return an object.

To get started on this we need to:

a.  Create a blank test function.
b.  Give the test a name that is a clear, testable statement.

Creating a blank test is easy, go to `processor.spec.js` and add an
empty test method. Tests in Jasmine are declared with an `it` function.
Remember that tests go inside of the `describe` function, which along
with the string parameter describe the group of tests inside.

``` {.js linenos=""}
describe("transmission processor", function() {

   it("", function(){

   });

});
```

Give the test the name `"takes a string and returns an object"`.

``` {.js linenos=""}
describe("transmission processor", function() {

   it("takes a string returns an object", function() {

   });

});
```

Now that we identified a clear goal for the test, let\'s add logic and
`expect` calls in the test to verify the desired behavior. *But
wait\...* we haven\'t added anything except an empty test at this point.
There isn\'t any actual code to verify. That\'s okay, this is part of
the TDD process.

We are going to think about and visualize how this feature should be
implemented in code. Then we will write out in the test how this new
code will be used.

We need to think of something that will satisfy the statement
`it("takes a string and returns an object"`. The `it` will be a function
that is imported from a module. Below on line 2, a `processor` function
is imported from the `processor.js` module.

``` {.js linenos=""}
const processor = require('../processor.js');

describe("transmission processor", function() {

   it("takes a string and returns an object", function(){

   });

});
```

We have an idea for a function named `processor` and we have imported
it. Keep in mind this function only exists as a concept and we are
writing a test to see if this concept makes sense.

Now for the real heart of the test. We are going to use
`expect().toEqual()` to verify that if we pass a string to `processor`,
an object is returned. Carefully review lines 7 and 8 shown below.

``` {.js linenos=""}
const processor = require('../processor.js');

describe("transmission processor", function() {

   it("takes a string and returns an object", function(){
      let result = processor("9701::<489584872710>");
      expect(typeof result).toEqual("object");
   });

});
```

On line 7 the `processor` function is called, with the value being
stored in a `result` variable. On line 8 the result of the expression
`typeof result` is compared to the value `"object"`. Reminder that the
`typeof operator <typeof>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} returns a
string representation of a type. If `typeof result` evaluates to the
string `"object"`, then we know that `processor` returned an object.

### Code Red

Let\'s run the test! Click the `run >` button in your repl.it. You
should see an error about `processor.js` not existing. This makes sense,
because we have not created the file yet. We are officially in the Red
phase of Red, Green, Refactor!

    Error: Cannot find module '../processor.js'

### Go Green!

Now that we have a failing test, we have only one choice. Make it pass.

a.  Add a `processor.js` file to your repl.it.
b.  Inside of the module declare a `processor` function that takes a
    parameter and returns an object.

Contents of the new `processor.js` file.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function processor(transmission) {
   return {};
}

module.exports = processor;
```

*Run the test again.*

We did it! `1 spec, 0 failures` means 1 passing test. In repl.it you
have to imagine the satisfying green color of a passing test.

    1 spec, 0 failures
    Finished in 0.011 seconds

### Refactor if Needed

This solution is very simple and does not need to be improved. The
refactor step does not always lead to an actual changing of your code.
The most important part is to review your code to make sure that it\'s
efficient and meets your team\'s standards.

## Requirement #2

*Requirement:* Return `-1` if the transmission does NOT contain `"::"`.

Next we have a negative test requirement that tells us what should
happen if the data is invalid. Before jumping into the code, let\'s
review the steps we took to implement requirement #1.

Review of TDD process:

1.  Create a blank test function.
2.  Give the test a name that is a clear, testable statement.
3.  Come up with test data that will trigger the described behavior.
4.  Think about what is needed, then write code that fulfills the stated
    behavior.
5.  Run the test and see the it fail.
6.  Implement the new code or feature used in the test.
7.  Run the test and see it pass.
8.  Review to see if refactor needed.

For requirement #2, the solution for *steps 1 - 4* can be seen on lines
*11 - 14* below.

``` {.js linenos=""}
const processor = require('../processor.js');

describe("transmission processor", function() {

   it("takes a string and returns an object", function(){
      let result = processor("9701::<489584872710>");
      expect(typeof result).toEqual("object");
   });

   it("returns -1 if '::' not found", function(){
      let result = processor("9701<489584872710>");
      expect(result).toEqual(-1);
   });

});
```

Now for *step 5*, run the test and see it fail. When you run the tests,
you should see the below error message. Notice that `-1` was the
expected value, but the actual value was and empty object, `{}`.

    Failures:
    1) transmission processor returns -1 if '::' not found
       Message:
          Expected Input A to equal Input B

Next is *step 6*, write code that will make the test pass. Go to
`processor.js` and update the `processor` function to check the
`transmission` argument for the presence of `'::'`.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function processor(transmission) {
   if (transmission.indexOf("::") < 0) {
      // Data is invalid
      return -1;
   }
   return {};
}

module.exports = processor;
```

Lucky *step 7* is to run the tests again. They should both pass.

    2 specs, 0 failures
    Finished in 0.035 seconds

Finally *step 8* is to review the code to see if it needs to be
refactored. As with the first requirement our code is quite simple and
can not be improved at this time.

## Requirement #3

*Requirement:* Returned object should contain an `id` property. The `id`
is the part of the transmission *before* the `"::"`

The same steps will be followed, even though they are not explicitly
listed.

See lines *16 - 19* to see the test added for this requirement. To test
this case `not.toEqual()` was used, which is checking if the two values
are NOT equal. `not.toEqual()` is used to make sure that `result.id` is
NOT equal to `undefined`. Remember that if you reference a property on
an object that does NOT exist, `undefined` is returned.

``` {.js linenos=""}
const processor = require('../processor.js');

describe("transmission processor", function() {

   it("takes a string returns an object", function(){
      let result = processor("9701::<489584872710>");
      expect(typeof result).toEqual("object");
   });

   it("returns -1 if '::' not found", function(){
      let result = processor("9701<489584872710>");
      expect(result).toEqual(-1);
   });

   it("returns id in object", function() {
     let result = processor("9701::<489584872710>");
     expect(result.id).not.toEqual(undefined);
   });

});
```

The fail message looks a little different than what we have seen. The
phrase \"Expected \'actual\' to be strictly unequal to\" lets us know
that the two values were equal when we didn\'t expect them to be.

    Failures:
    1) transmission processor returns id in object
       Message:
          Expected "actual" to not equal undefined

The object returned from `processor` doesn\'t have an `id` property. We
need to split the transmission on `'::'` and then add that value to the
object with the key `id`. See solution in `processor.js` below.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function processor(transmission) {
   if (transmission.indexOf("::") < 0) {
      // Data is invalid
      return -1;
   }
   let parts = transmission.split("::");
   return {
      id: parts[0]
   };
}

module.exports = processor;
```

Run the tests again. That did it. The tests pass! :-)

Line 6 splits `transmission` into the `parts` array, and line 8 assigns
the first entry in the array to the key `id`.

    3 specs, 0 failures
    Finished in 0.011 seconds

## Requirement #4

*Requirement:* The `id` property should be of type `Number`.

Again the same steps are followed, though not listed.

New test to be added to `specs/processor.spec.js`:

``` {.js linenos=""}
it("converts id to a number", function() {
   let result = processor("9701::<489584872710>");
   expect(result.id).toEqual(9701);
});
```

Fail Message

    Failures:
       1) transmission processor converts id to a number
          Message:
             Expected '9701' to equal 9701.

Convert the id part of the string to be of type `number`.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function processor(transmission) {
   if (transmission.indexOf("::") < 0) {
      // Data is invalid
      return -1;
   }
   let parts = transmission.split("::");
   return {
      id: Number(parts[0])
   };
}

module.exports = processor;
```

Now for the great feeling of a passing tests!

You may be wondering what happens if that data is bad and the id can\'t
be turned into a number. That is a negative test case related to this
feature and is left for you to address in the final section.
:::

## Requirement #5

*Requirement:* Returned object should contain a `rawData` property. The
`rawData` is the part of the transmission *after* the `"::"`

New test to be added to `specs/processor.spec.js`

``` {.js linenos=""}
it("returns rawData in object", function() {
   let result = processor("9701::<487297403495720912>");
   expect(result.rawData).not.toEqual(undefined);
});
```

Fail Message

    Failures:
    1) transmission processor returns rawData in object
       Message:
          Expected "actual" to not equal undefined

We need to extract the `rawData` from the second half of the
transmission string after it\'s been split. Then return that in the
object.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function processor(transmission) {
   if (transmission.indexOf("::") < 0) {
      // Data is invalid
      return -1;
   }
   let parts = transmission.split("::");
   let rawData = parts[1];
   return {
      id: Number(parts[0]),
      rawData: rawData
   };
}

module.exports = processor;
```

It\'s that time again, our tests pass!

    5 specs, 0 failures
    Finished in 0.041 seconds

## Requirement #6

*Requirement:* Return `-1` for the value `rawData` if the `rawData` part
of the transmission does NOT start with `<` and end with `>`.

Let\'s think about what test data to use for this requirement. What ways
could the transmission data be invalid?

1.  It could be missing `<` at the beginning
2.  It could be missing `>` at the end
3.  It could be missing both `<` and `>`
4.  Has `<` but the symbol is in the wrong place
5.  Has `>` but the symbol is in the wrong place

All these cases need to be covered by a test. Let\'s start with #1,
which is missing `<` at the beginning.

New test to be added to `specs/processor.spec.js`

``` {.js linenos=""}
it("returns -1 for rawData if missing < at position 0", function() {
   let result = processor("9701::487297403495720912>");
   expect(result.rawData).toEqual(-1);
});
```

Fail Message

    Failures:
    1) transmission processor returns -1 for rawData if missing < at position 0
       Message:
          Expected values to be equal

Now add new code to `processor.js` to make the tests pass. Note that we
don\'t simply return `-1`, the requirement is to return the object and
set the value of `rawData` to `-1`.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function processor(transmission) {
   if (transmission.indexOf("::") < 0) {
      // Data is invalid
      return -1;
   }
   let parts = transmission.split("::");
   let rawData = parts[1];
   if (rawData[0] !== "<") {
      rawData = -1;
   }
   return {
      id: Number(parts[0]),
      rawData: rawData
   };
}

module.exports = processor;
```

You know what\'s next, our tests pass!

    6 specs, 0 failures
    Finished in 0.056 seconds

::: admonition
Try It!

The test data we used was missing `<` at the beginning. Add tests to
cover these cases. `-1` should be returned as the value for `rawData`
for all of these.

-   `"9701::8729740349572>0912"`
-   `"9701::4872<97403495720912"`
-   `"9701::487297403495720912"`
-   `"9701::<487297403495<720912>"`

## Use TDD to Add These Features

Use the steps demonstrated above to implement all or some of the
features below. Take your time, you can do it!

1.  Trim leading and trailing whitespace from `transmission`.
2.  Return `-1` if the `id` part of the `transmission` cannot be
    converted to a number.
3.  Return `-1` if more than one `"::"` is found in `transmission`.
4.  Do not include the `< >` symbols in the value assigned to `rawData`.
5.  Return `-1` for the value of `rawData` if anything besides numbers
    are present between the `< >` symbols.
