# Other Operators

## The String Operator `+`

::: index
pair: string; concatenation
:::

So far we have only seen operators that work on operands which are of
type `number`, but there are operators that work on other data types as
well. In particular, the `+` operator can be used with `string` operands
to **concatenate**, or join together two strings.

::: admonition
Example

`"Launch" + "Code"` evaluates to `"LaunchCode"`
:::

Let\'s compare `+` used with numbers to `+` used with strings.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
console.log(1 + 1);
console.log("1" + "1");
```

**Console Output**

This example demonstrates that **the operator + behaves differently
based on the data type of its operands.**

Warning
:::

So far we have only seen examples of operators working with data of like
type. For the examples `1 + 1` and `"1" + "1"`, both operands are of
type `number` and `string`, respectively.

It is possible, however, to mix types with an expression such as
`1 + "1"`. The results of doing so can be unexpected, and at this stage
of your coding journey we strongly advise against creating such
expressions.

We will explore such \"mixed\" operations in a later chapter.

## Compound Assignment Operators

::: index
! compound assignment
:::

A common programming task is to update the value of a variable in
reference to itself.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let x = 1;
x = x + 1;

console.log(x);
```

**Console Output**

Line 2 may seem odd to you at first, since it uses the value of the
variable `x` to update `x` itself. This technique is not only legal in
JavaScript (and programming in general) but is quite common. It
essentially says, \"update `x` to be one more than its current value.\"

This action is so common, in fact, that it has a shorthand operator,
`+=`. The following example has the same behavior as the one above.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let x = 1;
x += 1;

console.log(x);
```

**Console Output**

The expression `x += 1` is shorthand for `x = x + 1`.

There is an entire family of such shorthand operators, known as
**compound assignment operators**.

  Operator name               Shorthand   Meaning
  --------------------------- ----------- -------------
  Addition assignment         `a += b`    `a = a + b`
  Subtraction assignment      `a -= b`    `a = a - b`
  Multiplication assignment   `a *= b`    `a = a * b`
  Division assignment         `a /= b`    `a = a / b`
