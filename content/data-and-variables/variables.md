# Variables

::: index
! variable
:::

One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the
ability to manipulate variables. A **variable** is a name that refers to
a value. Recall that a value is a single, specific piece of data, such
as a specific number or string. Variables allow us to store values for
later use.

A useful visual analogy for how a variable works is that of a label that
*points to* a piece of data.

<figure>
<img src="figures/variable.png" alt="figures/variable.png" />
<figcaption>A variable can be visualized as a label pointing to a
specific piece of data.</figcaption>
</figure>

In this figure, the name `programmingLanguage` points to the string
value `"JavaScript"`. This is more than an analogy, since it also is
representative of how a variable and its value are stored in a
computer\'s memory.

With this analogy in mind, let\'s look at how we can formally create
variables in JavaScript.

## Declaring and Initializing Variables With `let`

::: index
pair: variable; declaration
:::

::: index
! declaration
:::

To create a variable in JavaScript, create a new name for the variable
and precede it with the keyword `let`:

``` js
let programmingLanguage;
```

This creates a variable named `programmingLanguage`. The act of creating
a variable is referred to as **variable declaration**, or simply
**declaration**.

::: index
pair: variable; assignment pair: variable; initialization
:::

::: index
! assignment, ! initialization
:::

Once a variable has been declared, it may be given a value using an
**assignment statement**, which uses `=` to give a variable a value.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let programmingLanguage;
programmingLanguage = "JavaScript";
```

The act of assigning a variable a value for the first time is called
**initialization**.

The first line creates a variable that does not yet have a value. The
variable is a label that does not point to any data.

<figure>
<img src="figures/unassigned-variable.png" height="250"
alt="figures/unassigned-variable.png" />
<figcaption>The result of
<code>let programmingLanguage;</code></figcaption>
</figure>

The second line assigns the variable a value, which connects the name to
the given piece of data.

<figure>
<img src="figures/variable.png" alt="figures/variable.png" />
<figcaption>The result of
<code>programmingLanguage = "JavaScript";</code></figcaption>
</figure>

It is possible to declare *and* initialize a variable with a single line
of code. This is the most common way to create a variable.

``` js
let programmingLanguage = "JavaScript";
```

::: admonition
Warning

You will see some programmers use `var` to create a variable in
JavaScript, like this:

``` js
var programmingLanguage = "JavaScript";
```

While this is valid syntax, you should NOT use `var` to declare a
variable. Using `var` is old JavaScript syntax, and it differs from
`let` in important ways that we will learn about later. When you see
examples using `var`, use `let` instead.

If you\'re curious, read about [the differences between var and
let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables#The_difference_between_var_and_let).
:::

To give a variable a value, use the **assignment operator**, `=`. This
operator should not be confused with the concept of *equality*, which
expresses whether two things are the \"same\" (we will see later that
equality uses the `===` operator). The assignment statement links a
*name*, on the left-hand side of the operator, with a *value*, on the
right-hand side. This is why you will get an error if you try to run:

``` js
"JavaScript" = programmingLanguage;
```

An assignment statement must have the name on the left-hand side, and
the value on the right-hand side.

::: admonition
Tip

To avoid confusion when reading or writing code, say to yourself:

`programmingLanguage` is assigned `'JavaScript'`

or

`programmingLanguage` gets the value `'JavaScript'`.

Don\'t say:

`programmingLanguage` equals `'JavaScript'`.

::: index
pair: variable; global

::: admonition
Warning

What if, by mistake, you leave off `let` when declaring a variable?

``` js
programmingLanguage = "JavaScript";
```

Contrary to what you might expect, JavaScript will not complain or throw
an error. In fact, creating a variable without `let` is valid syntax,
but it results in very different behavior. Such a variable will be a
**global variable**, which we will discuss later.

The main point to keep in mind for now is that you should *always* use
`let` unless you have a specific reason not to do so.

## Evaluating Variables

::: index
variable; evaluation
:::

After a variable has been created, it may be used later in a program
anywhere a value may be used. For example, `console.log` prints a value,
we can also give `console.log` a variable.

::: admonition
Example

These two examples have the exact same output.

``` js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

``` {.js linenos=""}
let message = "Hello, World!";
console.log(message);
```
:::

When we refer to a variable name, we are **evaluating** the variable.
The effect is just as if the value of the variable is substituted for
the variable name in the code when executed.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let message = "What's up, Doc?";
let n = 17;
let pi = 3.14159;

console.log(message);
console.log(n);
console.log(pi);
```

**Console Output**

    What's up, Doc?
    17
    3.14159
:::

In each case, the printed result is the value of the variable.

Like values, variables also have types. We determine the type of a
variable the same way we determine the type of a value, using `typeof`.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let message = "What's up, Doc?";
let n = 17;
let pi = 3.14159;

console.log(typeof message);
console.log(typeof n);
console.log(typeof pi);
```

**Console Output**

    string
    number
    number
:::

The type of a variable is the type of the data it currently refers to.

## Reassigning Variables

We use variables in a program to \"remember\" things, like the current
score at the football game. As their name implies, variables can change
over time, just like the scoreboard at a football game. You can assign a
value to a variable, and later assign it a different value.

To see this, read and then run the following program in a code editor.
You\'ll notice that we change the value of `day` three times, and on the
third assignment we even give it a value that is of a different data
type.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let day = "Thursday";
console.log(day);

day = "Friday";
console.log(day);

day = 21;
console.log(day);
```

A great deal of programming involves asking the computer to remember
things. For example, we might want to keep track of the number of missed
calls on your phone. Each time another call is missed, we can arrange to
update a variable so that it will always reflect the correct total of
missed calls.

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

We only use `let` when *declaring* a variable, that is, when we create
it. We do NOT use `let` when reassigning the variable to a different
value. In fact, doing so will result in an error.

## Check Your Understanding

::: admonition
Question

What is printed when the following code executes?

``` {.js linenos=""}
let day = "Thursday";
day = 32.5;
day = 19;
console.log(day);
```

1.  Nothing is printed. A runtime error occurs.
2.  `Thursday`
3.  `32.5`
4.  `19`
:::

::: admonition
Question

How can you determine the type of a variable?

1.  Print out the value and determine the data type based on the value
    printed.
2.  Use `typeof`.
3.  Use it in a known equation and print the result.
4.  Look at the declaration of the variable.
