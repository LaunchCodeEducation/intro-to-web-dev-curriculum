# Exercises: Data and Variables

Exercises appear regularly in the book. Just like the concept checks,
these exercises will check your understanding of the topics in this
chapter. They also provide good practice for the new skills.

We\'ve included our solutions to some (but not all) of the exercises so
that you can check your own work after you practice. As with any
learning opportunity, take it seriously and give every exercise a fair
shot before peeking at the solution. Our solution may not look exactly
like yours, but that\'s ok. There\'s often more than one way to solve a
problem with code.

You don\'t need to show proof of completing the exercises to pass, so do
them for your own benefit. And if they\'re hard or you get some answers
wrong on the first try, keep going! Your future self will thank you.

Unlike the concept checks, you will need a code editor to complete the
exercises. Fortunately, you
`created a free account <hello-world>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} on
Repl.it as part of the prep work.

Use this [Repl.it

started solving.

## The Data

Use the information given below about your space shuttle to complete the
exercises:

  Data                        Value
  --------------------------- ---------------
  Name of the space shuttle   Determination
  Shuttle Speed (mph)         17,500
  Distance to Mars (km)       225,000,000
  Distance to the Moon (km)   384,400
  Miles per kilometer         0.621

## The Exercises

A.  **Declare and assign variables**

    Declare and assign a variable for each item in the list above.

    *Hint*: When declaring and assigning your variables, remember that
    you will need to use that variable throughout the rest of the
    exercises. Make sure that you are using the correct data type!

    `Check your solution <data-and-variables-exercise-solutionsA>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

B.  **Print out the type of each variable**

    For each variable you declared in part A, use the `typeof` operator
    to print its type to the console, one item per line.

    Click \"Run\" (in repl.it) and verify that your code works before
    moving to part C.

C.  **Calculate a space mission!**

    We need to determine how many days it will take to reach Mars.

    1.  Create and assign a miles to Mars variable. You can get the
        miles to Mars by multiplying the distance to Mars in kilometers
        by the miles per kilometer.

        `Check your solution <data-and-variables-exercise-solutionsC1>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"}

    2.  Next, we need a variable to hold the hours it would take to get
        to Mars. To get the hours, you need to divide the miles to Mars
        by the shuttle\'s speed.

        `Check your solution <data-and-variables-exercise-solutionsC2>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"}

    3.  Finally, declare a variable and assign it the value of days to
        Mars. In order to get the days it will take to reach Mars, you
        need to divide the hours it will take to reach Mars by 24.

        `Check your solution <data-and-variables-exercise-solutionsC3>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"}

D.  **Print out the results of your calculations**

    Using variables from above, print to the screen a sentence that says
    `"_____ will take ___ days to reach Mars."` Fill in the blanks with
    the shuttle name and the calculated time.

    Click \"Run\" (in repl.it) and verify that your code works before
    moving on.

E.  **Now calculate a trip to the Moon**

    Repeat the calculations, but this time determine the number of days
    it would take to travel to the Moon and print to the screen a
    sentence that says `"_____ will take ___ days to reach the Moon."`.
