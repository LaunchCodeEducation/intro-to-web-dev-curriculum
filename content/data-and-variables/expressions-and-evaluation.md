# Expressions and Evaluation

::: index
! expression
:::

An **expression** is a combination of values, variables, operators, and
calls to functions. An expression can be thought of as a formula that is
made up of multiple pieces.

::: index
pair: expression; evaluation pair: expression; return value

::: index
! returns
:::

The *evaluation* of an expression produces a value, known as the
**return value**. We say that an expression **returns** a value.

Expressions need to be evaluated when the code executes in order to
determine the return value, or specific piece of data that should be
used. Evaluation is the process of computing the return value.

If you ask JavaScript to print an expression using `console.log`, the
interpreter **evaluates** the expression and displays the result.

Example

``` js
console.log(1 + 1);
```

**Console Output**

    2
:::

This code prints not `1 + 1` but rather the *result* of calculating
`1 + 1`. In other words, `console.log(1 + 1)` prints the value `2`. This
is what we would expect.

Since evaluating an expression produces a value, expressions can appear
on the right-hand side of assignment statements.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let sum = 1 + 2;
console.log(sum);
```

**Console Output**

    3
:::

The value of the variable `sum` is the result of evaluating the
expression `1 + 2`, so the value `3` is printed.

A value all by itself is a simple expression, and so is a variable.
Evaluating a variable gives the value that the variable refers to. This
means that line 2 of the example above also contains the simple
expression `sum`.
