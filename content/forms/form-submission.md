# Form Submission

::: index
single: form; submission

Forms collect data input by the user. As we learned in the previous
chapter, communication on the web occurs via a series of HTTP requests
and responses. A **form submission** is an HTTP request sent to the
server containing the values in a form.

## Trigger Form Submission

A form submission is triggered by clicking a button inside the form. A
submit button can be an `input` element with `type=submit` or a `button`
element. Both button types are in the below example.

``` {.html linenos=""}
<form>
   <label>Username <input type="text" name="username"></label>
   <!-- clicking either of these will cause a form submission -->
   <input type="submit"/>
   <button>Submit</button>
</form>
```

When a form is submitted, an HTTP request is sent to the location set in
the `action` attribute of the `<form>` tag.

If the action attribute is not present or is empty, then the form will
submit to the URL of the current page.

Try It!

Open [this form](https://form-default--launchcode.repl.co/) in a
browser. Type values into the inputs, click the Submit button, and
notice what happens to the address bar.

``` {.html linenos=""}
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Form Example</title>
      <style>
         body { padding: 25px;}
      </style>
   </head>
   <body>
      <form action="">
         <label>Username <input type="text" name="username"></label>
         <label>Team Name <input type="text" name="team"></label>
         <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
   </body>
</html>
```

Notice in the above example that the browser address has changed to:

    https://form-default--launchcode.repl.co/?username=salina&team=Space+Coders

The web address is the same as the form we loaded, but now includes a
query parameter for *every* input, with a name, in the form. These
parameters are known as the query string parameters. The form values are
submitted via the query string because the default submission type for
forms is GET. In the next section, we will soon learn how to submit form
data via POST.

Since spaces are not allowed in URLs, the browser replaces them with
`+`.

### Key-value Pairs

When a form is submitted a key-value pair is created for each named
input. The keys are the values of the `name` attributes, and they are
paired with the content of the `value` attributes.

Form with two named inputs:

``` html
<form action="">
   <label>Username <input type="text" name="username"></label>
   <label>Team Name <input type="text" name="team"></label>
   <button>Submit</button>
</form>
```

When this form is submitted with the values from the previous example,
the query string looks like this:

    username=salina&team=Space+Coders
