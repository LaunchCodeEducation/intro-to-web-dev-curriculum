## Version Control Systems

A version control system (VCS) is a system for tracking changes to a code base and storing each version.
Version control systems assist programmers with keeping backups and a history of the revisions made to the code base over time.
With that history, programmers can roll back to a version without a particular bug.
A VCS also enables collaboration between programmers as they can work on different versions of a code base and share their work. 

Git is one VCS and is prevalent amongst programmers and corporations.

A VCS uses a **repository** or storage container for the code base. We have seen repositories before in Git.
Repositories include the files within the code base, the versions over time and a log of the changes made.
When we make updates to the repository, we are making **commits**.
