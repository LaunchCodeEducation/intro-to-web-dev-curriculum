# What is Git?

## Version Control Systems

A version control system (VCS) is a system for tracking changes to a
code base and storing each version. Version control systems assist
programmers with keeping backups and a history of the revisions made to
the code base over time. With that history, programmers can roll back to
a version without a particular bug. A VCS also enables collaboration
between programmers as they can work on different versions of a code
base and share their work.

Git is one VCS and is prevalent amongst programmers and corporations.

A VCS has a **repository** or storage container for the code base.
Repositories include the files within the code base, the versions over
time and a log of the changes made. When a programmer updates the
repository, it means they are making a **commit**.

## Getting Started with Git

In order to get started with Git, you need to install
`Git <git-install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} on your machine and
`install Visual Studio Code <vsc-install>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
