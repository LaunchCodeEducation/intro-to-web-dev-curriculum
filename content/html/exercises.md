# Exercises: HTML

Complete the HTML file for this simple web page. Add lines to
`index.html` that do the following.

1.  Add a `h1` to the page that says \"Why I Love Web Development\".

    `Check your solution <html-exercise-solutions1>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

2.  Add an ordered list to the page with 3 reasons why you love web
    development.

3.  Add a link to this page below your list.

    `Check your solution <html-exercise-solutions3>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

4.  Add a paragraph about the website you want to make with your web
    development superpowers!

This code block gives you a rough outline for how it might look.

Note

repl.it has other HTML inside of the `index.html` file you will be
editing. You should only add code, NOT delete!

In addition, when clicking on your link to make sure it works,
right-click to open in a new tab.
