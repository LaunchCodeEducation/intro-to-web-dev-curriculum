JavaScript provides several built-in objects, which can be called directly by
the user. One of these is the `Math` object, which contains more than the
standard mathematical operations (`+, -, *, /`).

In the previous sections, we learned how to construct, modify, and use objects
such as `giraffe`. However, JavaScript built-in objects cannot be modified
by the user.

> Unlike other objects, the `Math` object is *immutable*.

## `Math` Properties Are Constants

The `Math` object has 8 defined properties. These represent *mathematical
constants*, like the value for pi (Ï€) or the square root of 2.

Instead of defining a variable to hold as many digits of pi as we can remember,
JavaScript stores the value for us. To use this value, we do NOT need to
create a new object. By using dot notation and calling `Math.PI`, we can
access the value of pi.

{{% notice blue "Example" "rocket" %}}

   ```js {linenos=true}
      console.log(Math.PI);
      console.log(Math.PI*4);
      console.log(Math.PI + Math.PI);
   ```

   **Console Output**
   
   ```console
      3.141592653589793
      12.566370614359172
      6.283185307179586
   ```

{{% /notice %}}

As stated above, the properties within `Math` *cannot* be changed by the
user.

{{% notice blue "Example" "rocket" %}}

   ```js {linenos=true}
      console.log(Math.PI);

      Math.PI = 1234;

      console.log(Math.PI);
   ```

   **Console Output**

   ```console
      3.141592653589793
      3.141592653589793
   ```

{{% /notice %}}

To use one of the other constants stored in `Math`, we replace `PI` with
the property name (e.g. `SQRT2` stores the value for the square root of 2).

## Other `Math` Properties

Besides the value of pi, JavaScript provides [7 other constants](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_math.asp).
How useful you find each of these depends on the type of project you need to
complete.

More powerful uses of the `Math` object involve using *methods*, which we
will examine next.
