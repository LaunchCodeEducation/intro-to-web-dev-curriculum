# Exercises: Objects & Math {#exercises-objects-and-math}

At our space base, it is a historic day! Five non-human animals are
ready to run a space mission without our assistance! For the exercises,
you will use the same five animal objects throughout.

[Starter Code](https://repl.it/@launchcode/ObjectsExercises/)

## Part 1: Create More Objects

Based on the two object literals provided in the starter code, create
new object literals for three more animals:

  Name     Species      Mass (kg)      Age (years)
  -------- ------------ -------------- -------------
  Brad     Chimpanzee   11             6
  Leroy    Beagle       14             5
  Almina   Tardigrade   0.0000000001   1

  : Animal Astronauts

### Add a New Property

For each animal, add a property called `astronautID`. Each `astronautID`
should be assigned a number between 1 and 10 (including 10). However, no
crew members should have the same ID.

### Add a Method

Add a `move` method to each animal object. The `move` method will select
a random number of steps from 0 to 10 for the animal to take. The number
can be 0 as well as 10.

### Store the Objects

Create a `crew` array to store all of the animal objects.

## Part 2: Crew Reports

Upper management at the space base wants us to report all of the
relevant information about the animal astronauts.

Define a `crewReports` function to accomplish this. When passed one of
the animal objects, the function returns a template literal with the
following string:
`'____ is a ____. They are ____ years old and ____ kilograms. Their ID is ____.'`

Fill in the blanks with the name, species, age, mass, and ID for the
selected animal.

## Part 3: Crew Fitness

Before these animal astronauts can get ready for launch, they need to
take a physical fitness test. Define a `fitnessTest` function that takes
an array as a parameter.

Within the function, race the five animals together by using the `move`
method. An animal is done with the race when they reach 20 steps or
greater. Store the result as a string:
`'____ took ____ turns to take 20 steps.'` Fill in the blanks with the
animal's name and race result. Create a new array to store how many
turns it takes each animal to complete the race.

Return the array from the function, then print the results to the
console (one animal per line).

*HINT*: There are a lot of different ways to approach this problem. One
way that works well is to see how many iterations of the `move` method
it will take for each animal to reach 20 steps.
