# Coding With Objects

## Booleans and Objects {#comparing-objects}

Objects are not stored by their properties or by value, but by
[reference]{.title-ref}. Storing something by reference means that it is
stored based on its location in memory. This can lead to some confusion
when comparing objects.

::: admonition
Example

Let\'s see how this affects our zoo software! Surely, the zoo has more
than one tortoise. The second tortoise is named Patricia!

``` {.js linenos=""}
let tortoiseTwo = {
   species: "Galapagos Tortoise",
   name: "Patricia",
   weight: 800,
   age: 85,
   diet: ["pumpkins", "lettuce", "cabbage"],
   sign: function() {
      return this.name + " is a " + this.species;
   }
 };
```

Because Pete and Patricia are members of the same species, are the same
age, and have the same diet, you might notice that many of their
properties are equal, but some are not. Pete weighs more than Patricia
and of course, they have different names!

For this example, we will only keep the `species` and `diet` properties.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let tortoiseOne = {
   species: "Galapagos Tortoise",
   diet: ["pumpkins", "lettuce", "cabbage"]
};

let tortoiseTwo = {
   species: "Galapagos Tortoise",
   diet: ["pumpkins", "lettuce", "cabbage"]
};

console.log(tortoiseOne === tortoiseTwo);
```

**Console Output**

    false

The objects contain properties that have the same keys and equal values.
However, the output is `false`.
:::

Even though `tortoiseOne` and `tortoiseTwo` have the same keys and
values, they are stored in separate locations in memory. This means that
even though you can compare the properties in different objects for
equality, you cannot compare the objects themselves for equality.

## Iterating Through Objects

We can iterate through all of the values in an object, much like we
would do with an array. We will use a for loop to do that, but with a
slightly different structure. `for...in` loops are specifically designed
to loop through the properties of an object. Each iteration of the loop
accesses a key in the object. The loop stops once it has accessed every
property.

Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let giraffe = {
  species: "Reticulated Giraffe",
  name: "Cynthia",
  weight: 1500,
  age: 15,
  diet: "leaves"
};

for (item in giraffe) {
   console.log(item + ", " + giraffe[item]);
}
```

**Console Output**

    species, Reticulated Giraffe
    name, Cynthia
    weight, 1500
    age, 15
    diet, leaves

In this example, `item` is a variable that holds the string for each
key. It is updated with each iteration of the loop.
:::

::: admonition
Note

Inside a `for..in` loop, we can only use bracket syntax to access the
property values.
:::

::: admonition
Try It!

Write a `for..in` loop to print to the console the values in the
`tortoiseOne` object. [Try it at
repl.it](https://repl.it/@launchcode/forinLoop/)

## Objects and Functions

Programmers can pass an object as the input to a function, or use an
object as the return value of the function. Any change to the object
within the function will change the object itself.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let giraffe = {
  species: "Reticulated Giraffe",
  name: "Cynthia",
  weight: 1500,
  age: 15,
  diet: "leaves"
};

function birthday(animal) {
    animal.age = animal.age + 1;
    return animal;
}

console.log(giraffe.age);

birthday(giraffe);

console.log(giraffe.age);
```

**Console Output**

    15
    16

On line 16, when the `birthday` function is called, `giraffe` is passed
in as an argument and returned. After the function call, `giraffe.age`
increases by 1.

## Check Your Understanding

::: admonition
Question

What type of loop is designed for iterating through the properties in an
object?
:::

::: admonition
Question

Given the following object definitions, which statement returns `true`?

``` {.js linenos=""}
let tortoiseOne = {
   age: 150,
   species: "Galapagos Tortoise",
   diet: ["pumpkins", "lettuce", "cabbage"]
};

let tortoiseTwo = {
   age: 150,
   species: "Galapagos Tortoise",
   diet: ["pumpkins", "lettuce", "cabbage"]
};
```

a.  `tortoiseOne == tortoiseTwo`
b.  `tortoiseOne === tortoiseTwo`
c.  `tortoiseOne.age === tortoiseTwo.age`
