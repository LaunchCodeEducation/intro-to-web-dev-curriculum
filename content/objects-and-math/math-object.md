# The `Math` Object

JavaScript provides several built-in objects, which can be called
directly by the user. One of these is the `Math` object, which contains
more than the standard mathematical operations (`+, -, *, /`).

In the previous sections, we learned how to construct, modify, and use
objects such as `giraffe`. However, JavaScript built-in objects cannot
be modified by the user.

> Unlike other objects, the `Math` object is *immutable*.

## `Math` Properties Are Constants

The `Math` object has 8 defined properties. These represent
*mathematical constants*, like the value for pi (Ï€) or the square root
of 2.

Instead of defining a variable to hold as many digits of pi as we can
remember, JavaScript stores the value for us. To use this value, we do
NOT need to create a new object. By using dot notation and calling
`Math.PI`, we can access the value of pi.

Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
console.log(Math.PI);
console.log(Math.PI*4);
console.log(Math.PI + Math.PI);
```

**Console Output** :

    3.141592653589793
    12.566370614359172
    6.283185307179586

As stated above, the properties within `Math` *cannot* be changed by the
user.

Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
console.log(Math.PI);

Math.PI = 1234;

console.log(Math.PI);
```

**Console Output** :

    3.141592653589793
    3.141592653589793

To use one of the other constants stored in `Math`, we replace `PI` with
the property name (e.g. `SQRT2` stores the value for the square root of
2).

## Other `Math` Properties

Besides the value of pi, JavaScript provides [7 other
constants](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_math.asp). How
useful you find each of these depends on the type of project you need to
complete.

More powerful uses of the `Math` object involve using *methods*, which
we will examine next.
