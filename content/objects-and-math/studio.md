# Studio: Objects & Math

In the exercises, you created objects to store data about the candidates
for our animal astronaut corps. For this studio, we provide you with a
ready-made set of candidates.

You must create code to:

A.  Select the crew.
B.  Perform critical mission calculations.
C.  Determine the fuel required for launch.

## Select the Crew

To access the code for exercise 1, open this [repl.it
link](https://repl.it/@launchcode/ObjectsStudio01).

### Randomly Select ID Numbers

Each candidate was assigned an ID number, which is stored in the
candidate\'s data file and in the `idNumbers` array.

1.  Write a `selectRandomEntry` function to select a random entry from
    the `idNumbers` array. Review the
    `Combining Math Methods <random-array-item>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} section if you need a reminder on how to do this.
2.  Call the function three times to select three ID numbers. Store
    these selections in a new array, making sure to avoid repeated
    numbers. No animal can be selected more than once!

::: admonition
Tip

`arrayName.includes(item)` can be used to check if the array already
contains `item`. A `while` loop can keep the selection process going
until the desired number of entries have been added to the array.
:::

### Build a `crew` Array

Design a function that takes two arrays as parameters. These hold the
randomly selected ID numbers and the candidate objects.

Use one or more loops to check which animals hold the lucky ID numbers.
They will be going on the space mission! Store these animals in a `crew`
array, and then return that array.

Use a template literal to print,
`'____, ____, and ____ are going to space!'` Fill in the blanks with the
names of the selected animals.

## Orbit Calculations

To access the code for the orbit calculations and first bonus mission,
go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/@launchcode/ObjectsStudio02).

1.  Spacecraft orbits are not circular, but we will assume that our
    mission is special. The animals will achieve a circular orbit with
    an altitude of 2000 km.
    a.  Define a function that returns the circumference (C = 2Ï€r) of
        the orbit. Round the circumference to an integer.

    b.  Define the `missionDuration` function to take three parameters -
        the number of orbits completed, the orbit radius, and the
        orbital speed. Set the default radius to 2000 km and the default
        orbital speed to 28000 km/hr.

    c.  Calculate how long it will take our animals to complete a
        certain number of orbits (`time = distance/speed`). Round the
        answer to 2 decimal places, then return the result.

        For example, with the default radius and speed, 5 orbits will
        take about `2.24 hours`.

    d.  Print,
        `'The mission will travel ____ km around the planet, and it will take ____ hours to complete.'`
2.  Time for an excursion! Code an `oxygenExpended` function to
    accomplish the following:
    a.  The function should take a candidate object as a parameter and
        NOT the `crew` array.

        ::: admonition
        Note

        When you call `oxygenExpended`, feel free to use your
        `selectRandomEntry` to pick the crew member to pass into the
        function.
        :::

    b.  The spacewalk will last for three orbits around the earth. Use
        `missionDuration` to calculate how many hours the spacewalk will
        take.

    c.  Use the candidate\'s `o2Used` method to calculate how much
        oxygen (O ~2~) they consume during the spacewalk. Round the
        answer to 3 decimal places.

    d.  Return the string,
        `'__ will perform the spacewalk, which will last __ hours and require __ kg of oxygen.'`
        Fill in the blanks with the animal\'s name, the spacewalk time,
        and the amount of O ~2~ used.

    e.  We should not restrict our mission to the default values for
        orbital radius and orbital speed. Refactor `oxygenExpended` to
        accept values for these items. Remember to include the values in
        the `missionDuration` call.

## Bonus Missions

### Conserve O ~2~

Instead of randomly selecting a crew member for the spacewalk, have your
program select the animal with the smallest oxygen consumption.

### Fuel Required for Launch

To access the code for this bonus mission, go to
[repl.it](https://repl.it/@launchcode/ObjectsStudio03).

A general rule of thumb states that it takes about 9 - 10 kg of rocket
fuel to lift 1 kg of mass into low-earth orbit (LEO). For our mission,
we will assume a value of 9.5 kg to calculate how much fuel we need to
launch our crew into space.

1.  Write a `crewMass` function that returns the total mass of the
    selected crew members rounded to 1 decimal place.
2.  The mass of the un-crewed rocket plus the food and other supplies is
    75,000 kg. Create a `fuelRequired` function to combine the rocket
    and crew masses, then calculate and return the amount of fuel needed
    to reach LEO.
3.  Our launch requires a safety margin for the fuel level, especially
    if the crew members are cute and fuzzy. Add an extra 200 kg of fuel
    for each dog or cat on board, but only an extra 100 kg for the other
    species. Update `fuelRequired` to account for this, then round the
    final amount of fuel UP to the nearest integer.
4.  Print
    `'The mission has a launch mass of ____ kg and requires ____ kg of fuel.'`
    Fill in the blanks with the calculated amounts.
