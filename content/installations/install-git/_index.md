## Setting Up Git

### Mac Users

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Type the command, `git --version`, in the terminal.
3. If the output includes a Git version, like the code below, then you are ready to use Git!

```bash
LaunchCode-Super-Computer:~ launchcode-student$ git --version
git version 2.6.4 (Apple Git-63)
```

4. If the output does not include a Git version, then a popup will open and ask you to install Developer Tools. Click "Install"!
5. After the installation is done, you can double check that it worked by typing `git --version` and the version of Git will be part of the output!

### Windows Users

Since you already installed Git Bash when you set up your terminal, you are good to go!
