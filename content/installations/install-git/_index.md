## Setting Up Git

Git will help us track changes and versions of our code.

### Mac Users

1. Open a new terminal window.
1. Type the command, `git --version`, in the terminal.
1. If the output includes a Git version, like the code below, then you are ready to use Git!

   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   
   **Console Output**
   
   ```console
   git version 2.6.4 (Apple Git-63)
   ```

4. If the output does not include a Git version, then a popup will open and ask you to install Developer Tools. Click "Install"!
5. After the installation is done, you can double check that it worked by typing `git --version` and the version of Git will be part of the output!

### Windows Users

Since you already installed Git Bash when you [set up your terminal]({{< relref "../../installations/terminal-setup/#windows-users" >}}), you are good to go!
