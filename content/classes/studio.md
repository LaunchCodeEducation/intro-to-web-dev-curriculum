# Studio: Classes

## Getting Started

Let\'s create a class to handle new animal crew candidates!

Edit the [practice file](https://repl.it/@launchcode/ClassStudio01) as
you complete the studio activity.

## Part 1 - Add Class Properties

1.  Declare a class called `CrewCandidate` with a `constructor` that
    takes three parameters\-\--`name`, `mass`, and `scores`. Note that
    `scores` will be an array of test results.
2.  Create objects for the following candidates:
    a.  Bubba Bear has a mass of 135 kg and test scores of 88, 85, and
        90.
    b.  Merry Maltese has a mass of 1.5 kg and test scores of 93, 88,
        and 97.
    c.  Glad Gator has a mass of 225 kg and test scores of 75, 78, and
        62.

Use `console.log` for each object to verify that your class correctly
assigns the key/value pairs.

## Part 2 - Add First Class Method

As our candidates complete more tests, we need to be able to add the new
scores to their records.

1.  Create an `addScore` method in `CrewCandidate`. The function must
    take a new score as a parameter. Code this function OUTSIDE of
    `constructor`. (If you need to review the syntax, revisit
    `Assigning Class Methods <adding-class-methods>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}).
2.  When passed a score, the function adds the value to `this.scores`
    with the
    `push array method <push-and-pop-examples>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
3.  Test out your new method by adding a score of `83` to Bubba\'s
    record, then print out the new score array with `objectName.scores`.

## Part 3 - Add More Methods

Now that we can add scores to our candidates\' records, we need to be
able to evaluate their fitness for our astronaut program. Let\'s add two
more methods to `CrewCandidate`\-\--one to average the test scores and
the other to indicate if the candidate should be admitted.

### Calculating the Test Average

1.  Add an `average()` method outside `constructor`. The function does
    NOT need a parameter.
2.  To find the average, add up the entries from `this.scores`, then
    divide the sum by the number of scores.
3.  To make the average easier to look at,
    `round it to 1 decimal place <rounding-to-decimal-places>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, then return the result from the function.

Verify your code by evaluating and printing Merry\'s average test score
(92.7).

### Determining Candidate Status

Candidates with averages at or above 90% are automatically accepted to
our training program. Reserve candidates average between 80 - 89%, while
probationary candidates average between 70 - 79%. Averages below 70%
lead to a rejection notice.

1.  Add a `status()` method to `CrewCandidate`. The method returns a
    string (`Accepted`, `Reserve`, `Probationary`, or `Rejected`)
    depending on a candidate\'s average.
2.  The `status` method requires the average test score, which can be
    called as a parameter OR from inside the function. That\'s correct -
    methods can call other methods inside a class! Just remember to use
    the `this` keyword.
3.  Once `status` has a candidate\'s average score, evaluate that score,
    and return the appropriate string.
4.  Test the `status` method on each of the three candidates. Use a
    template literal to print out
    `'___ earned an average test score of ___% and has a status of ___.'`

## Part 4 - Play a Bit

Use the three methods to boost Glad Gator\'s status to `Reserve` or
higher. How many tests will it take to reach `Reserve` status? How many
to reach `Accepted`? Remember, scores cannot exceed 100%.

Tip

Rather than adding one score at a time, could you use a loop?
