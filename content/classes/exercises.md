# Exercises: Classes

Welcome to the space station! It is your first day onboard and as the
newest and most junior member of the crew, you have been asked to
organize the library of manuals and fun novels for the crew to read.
Click on this [repl.it
link](https://repl.it/@launchcode/ClassExercises01) and fork the starter
code.

Headquarters have asked that you store the following information about
each book.

1.  The title
2.  The author
3.  The copyright date
4.  The ISBN
5.  The number of pages
6.  The number of times the book has been checked out.
7.  Whether the book has been discarded.

Headquarters also needs you to track certain actions that you must
perform when books get out of date. First, for a manual, the book must
be thrown out if it is over 5 years old. Second, for a novel, the book
should be thrown out if it has been checked out over 100 times.

1\. Construct three classes that hold the information needed by
headquarters as properties. One class should be a `Book` class and two
child classes of the `Book` class called `Manual` and `Novel`. Each
class will contain two methods. One will be a constructor. The other one
will either be in charge of disposal of the book or updating the
property related to the number of times a book has been checked out.
[Hint:]{.title-ref} This means you need to read through the requirements
for the problem and decide what should belong to `Book` and what should
belong to the `Novel` and `Manual` classes.

2\. Declare an object of the `Novel` class for the following tome from
the library:

4\. One of the above books needs to be discarded. Call the appropriate
method for that book to update the property. That way the crew can throw
it into empty space to become debris.

5\. The other book has been checked out 5 times since you first created
the object. Call the appropriate method to update the number of times
the book has been checked out.
