# What Are Classes?

Recall that `objects <objects-intro>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
data structures that hold many values, which consist of *properties* and
*methods*.

We often need to create many objects of the same *type*. To do this in
an efficient way, we define a **class**, which allows us to set up the
general structure for an object. We can then reuse that structure to
build multiple objects. These objects all have the same set of *keys*,
but the *values* assigned to each key will vary.

Let\'s revisit the animal astronauts from earlier exercises to see how
this works.

## An Astronaut Object

When we create an object to hold an astronaut\'s data, it might look
something like:

``` {.js linenos=""}
let fox = {
   name: 'Fox',
   age: 7,
   mass: 12,
   catchPhrase: function(repeats) {
      let phrase = 'LaunchCode';
      for (let i = 0; i < repeats; i++) {
         phrase += ' Rocks';
      }
      return phrase;
   }
}

console.log(`${fox.name} is ${fox.age} years old and has a mass of ${fox.mass} kg.`);
console.log(`${fox.name} says, "${fox.catchPhrase(3)}."`);
```

**Console Output**

    Fox is 7 years old and has a mass of 12 kg.
    Fox says, "LaunchCode Rocks Rocks Rocks."

The `fox` object contains all the data and functions for the astronaut
named `'Fox'`.

Of course, we have multiple astronauts on our team. To store data for
each one, we would need to copy the structure for `fox` multiple times
and then change the values to suit each crew member. This is inefficient
and repetitive.

By letting us define our own **classes**, JavaScript provides a better
way to create multiple, similar objects.
