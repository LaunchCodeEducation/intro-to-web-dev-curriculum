# Declaring and Calling a Class

## Creating a Class

Just like the `function` keyword defines a new function, the keyword for
defining a new class is `class`. By convention, class names start with
capital letters to distinguish them from JavaScript function and
variable names (e.g. `MyClass` vs. `myFunction`).

Remember that classes are blueprints for building multiple objects of
the same type. The general format for declaring a class is:

``` {.js linenos=""}
class ClassName {
   constructor(parameters) {
      //assign properties
   }
   //define methods
}
```

::: index
! constructor
:::

Note the keyword `constructor`. This is a special method for creating
objects of the same type, and it assigns the key/value pairs. Parameters
are passed into `constructor` rather than the `class` declaration.

### Assigning Properties

Let\'s set up an `Astronaut` class to help us store data about our
animal crew. Each animal has a `name`, `age`, and `mass`, and we assign
these properties in `constructor` as follows:

``` {.js linenos=""}
class Astronaut {
   constructor(name, age, mass) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.mass = mass;
   }
}
```

The `this` keyword defines a key/value pair, where the text attached to
`this` becomes the key, and the value follows the equal sign
(`this.key = value`).

`constructor` uses the three `this` statements (`this.name = name`,
etc.) to achieve the same result as the object declaration
`let objectName = {name: someString, age: someNumber, mass: someMass}`.
Each time the `Astronaut` class is called, `constructor` builds an
object with the SAME set of keys, but it assigns different values to the
keys based on the arguments.

::: admonition
Note

Each class requires *one* `constructor`. Including more than one
`constructor` results in a syntax error. If `constructor` is left out of
a class declaration, JavaScript adds an empty `constructor () {}`
automatically.
:::

## Creating a New Class Object

To create an object from a class, we use the keyword `new`. The syntax
is:

``` js
let objectName = new ClassName(arguments);
```

`new` creates an **instance** of the class, which means that the object
generated shares the same set of keys as every other object made from
the class. However, the values assigned to each key may differ.

::: admonition
Example

Let\'s create objects for two of our crew members: Fox and Hippo.

``` {.js linenos=""}
class Astronaut {
   constructor(name, age, mass){
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.mass = mass;
   }
}

let fox = new Astronaut('Fox', 7, 12);
let hippo = new Astronaut('Hippo', 25, 1500);

console.log(typeof hippo, typeof fox);

console.log(hippo, fox);
```

**Console Output**

    object object

    Astronaut { name: 'Hippo', age: 25, mass: 1500 }
    Astronaut { name: 'Fox', age: 7, mass: 12 }
:::

In lines 9 and 10, we call the `Astronaut` class twice and pass in
different sets of arguments, creating the `fox` and `hippo` objects.

The output of line 14 shows that `fox` and `hippo` are both the same
*type* of object (`Astronaut`). The two share the same *keys*, but they
have different values assigned to those keys.

::: admonition
Note

Two objects created from the same class are NOT equal, even if the keys
within the objects all have the same values. The reason behind this was
discussed `previously <comparing-objects>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
:::

After creating an `Astronaut` object, we can access, modify, or add new
key/value pairs as described in the
`Objects and Math chapter <objects-chapter>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

::: admonition
Try It

Play around with modifying and adding properties inside and outside of
the `class` declaration.

::: {.replit slug="classExamples01" linenos=""}
js

class Astronaut {

:   

    constructor(name, age, mass){

    :   this.name = name; this.age = age; this.mass = mass;

    }

}

let fox = new Astronaut(\'Fox\', 7, 12);

console.log(fox); console.log(fox.age, fox.color);

fox.age = 9; fox.color = \'red\';

console.log(fox); console.log(fox.age, fox.color);
:::

**Console Output**

    Astronaut { name: 'Fox', age: 7, mass: 12 }
    7 undefined
    Astronaut { name: 'Fox', age: 9, mass: 12, color: 'red' }
    9 'red'
:::

Attempting to print `fox.color` in line 12 returns `undefined`, since
that property is not included in the `Astronaut` class. Line 15 adds the
`color` property to the `fox` object, but this change will not affect
any other objects created with `Astronaut`.

### Setting Default Values

What happens if we create a new `Astronaut` without passing in all of
the required arguments?

::: admonition
Try It!

::: {.replit slug="classExamples02" linenos=""}
js

class Astronaut {

:   

    constructor(name, age, mass){

    :   this.name = name; this.age = age; this.mass = mass;

    }

}

let tortoise = new Astronaut(\'Speedy\', 120);

console.log(tortoise.name, tortoise.age, tortoise.mass);
:::
:::

To avoid issues with missing arguments, we can set a *default* value for
a parameter as follows:

``` {.js linenos=""}
class Astronaut {
   constructor(name, age, mass = 54){
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.mass = mass;
   }
}
```

Now if we call `Astronaut` but do not specify a mass value, the
constructor automatically assigns a value of `54`. If an argument is
included for `mass`, then the default value is ignored.

TRY IT! Return to the repl.it in the example above and set default
values for one or more of the parameters.

## Check Your Understanding

The questions below refer to a class called `Car`.

``` {.js linenos=""}
class Car {
   constructor(make, model, year, color, mpg){
      this.make = make;
      this.model = model;
      this.year = year;
      this.color = color;
      this.mpg = mpg;
   }
}
```
