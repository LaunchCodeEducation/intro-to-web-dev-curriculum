! inheritance, ! object-oriented programming

**Object-oriented programming** is a type of software design where the
codebase is organized around [objects]{.title-ref} and
[classes]{.title-ref}. Objects contain the functions and central logic
of a program.

Object-oriented programming stands on top of four principles:
abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. We will dive
into inheritance now and work with the other three principles in Unit
Two of this class.

**Inheritance** refers to the ability of one class to acquire properties
and methods from another.

Think of it this way, in the animal kingdom, a [species]{.title-ref} is
a unique entity that inherits traits from its [genus]{.title-ref}. The
[genus]{.title-ref} also has unique properties, but inherits traits from
its [family]{.title-ref}. For example, a tiger and a housecat are
members of two different species, however, they share similar traits
such as retractable claws. The two cats inherited their similar traits
from their shared family, [felidae]{.title-ref}.

Using inheritance in programming, we can create a structure of classes
that inherit properties and methods from other classes.

If we wanted to program classes for our tiger and housecat, we would
create a felidae class for the family. We would then create two classes
for the panthera genus and the felis genus. We would create classes for
the tiger and house cat species as well. The species classes would
inherit properties and methods from the genus classes and the genus
classes would inherit properties and methods from the family class.

! parent class, ! child class
:::

The classes inheriting properties and methods are **child classes**, and
the classes passing down properties and methods are **parent classes**.

## `extends`

When designating a class as the child class of another in JavaScript, we
use the `extends` keyword. We also must use the `super()` constructor to
get the properties and methods needed from the parent class.

``` {.js linenos=""}
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
   constructor () {
      super();
      // properties
   }
}
```

In the case of a tiger, tigers have stripes, but they also have loud
roars. Their ability to roar loudly is a trait they share with other
members of the [panthera]{.title-ref} genus. Tigers also got their
retractable claws from the [felidae]{.title-ref} family.

Example

::: {.replit slug="InheritanceTryIt" linenos=""}
js

class Felidae {

:   

    constructor() {

    :   this.claws = \"retractable\";

    }

}

class Panthera extends Felidae {

:   

    constructor() {

    :   super(); this.roar = \"loud\";

    }

}

class Tiger extends Panthera {

:   

    constructor() {

    :   super(); this.hasStripes = \"true\";

    }

}

let tigger = new Tiger();

console.log(tigger);
:::

When creating the classes for our tiger, we can use the `extends`
keyword to set up `Tiger` as the child class of `Panthera`. The `Tiger`
class then inherits the property, `roar`, from the `Panthera` class and
has an additional property, `hasStripes`.

The `extends` keyword is not supported in Internet Explorer.

Question

If you had to create classes for a *wolf*, the *canis* genus, and the
*carnivora* order, which statement is TRUE about the order of
inheritance?

a.  `Wolf` and `Canis` are parent classes to `Carnivora`.
b.  `Wolf` is a child class of `Canis` and a parent class to
    `Carnivora`.
c.  `Wolf` is child class of `Canis`, and `Canis` is a child class of
    `Carnivora`.
d.  `Wolf` is child class of `Canis`, and `Canis` is a parent class of
    `Carnivora`.
