# What is CSS?

## Background

As discussed in the previous chapter, HTML lays out the structure of a
document. With HTML attributes, programmers can add some specification
to tags. Yet, when programmers make pages with only HTML, the web pages
look rather bland. When making a web site, the structure of the page
elements is important, as is how those elements appear.

While HTML creates the structure and content of the page, CSS adds the
styling to make it beautiful! Cascading Styling Sheets (**CSS**) is a
style sheet language that allows programmers to add styling to web
documents. With CSS, programmers can change background and font colors,
the size of different elements, and many more things.

CSS works by applying style rules to different elements. A style rule
could be: \"Make this lettering purple\" or \"Make this font
Helvetica\". CSS is a [cascading]{.title-ref} style sheet language
because the style rules apply based on a specific precedence, so the
rules \"cascade\".
