to start.

## CSS Example

Adding CSS to the HTML page about Space Plants is the logical next step
in building a website about this cool discovery. The astronauts building
the site used the `body`, `h1`, and `p` selectors to change some of the
styling of those elements.

``` {.html linenos=""}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Plant-Loving Astronauts</title>
      <style>
         body {
           background-color: cornflowerblue;
         }
         h1 {
           color: green;
         }
         p {
           font-size: 18px;
         }
      </style>   
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Space Plants Are Cool</h1>
      <p>NASA discovers that plants can live in <b>outer space</b>. More innovations from this discovery to follow.</p>
      <img src = "space-flower.jpg" alt = "Flower floating in space.">
      <!-- This image was taken by NASA and is in the Public Domain -->
   </body>
 </html>
```
