# Exercises: CSS

We have built a website for you to test your CSS knowledge. Check out
the [repl.it](https://repl.it/@launchcode/CSSExercises/)!

For the exercises, add the following style rules to the website:

1.  Change the background color to yellow.

    `Check your solution <css-exercise-solutions1>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

2.  Change all paragraph text color to green.

3.  Change all `h1` to 36 px font size.

    `Check your solution <css-exercise-solutions3>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

4.  Align all text to the center of the page.

5.  Let\'s say that you don\'t like aligning all of the text to the
    center. Use a CSS class to align only the headings to the center of
    the page.

    `Check your solution <css-exercise-solutions5>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

6.  Change the font color of elements with the id, `cool-text`, to blue.

7.  Use a CSS id to change the elements in the ordered list to a color
    of your choosing.

    `Check your solution <css-exercise-solutions7>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

We learned from the reading that the location of CSS and the selector
type can change the order of precedence of the CSS rules. Try different
locations and selector types and see what happens!
