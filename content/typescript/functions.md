# Functions in TypeScript

When creating functions in TypeScript, we have many of the same options
as in JavaScript. We can make anonymous functions, give them a different
number of parameters, and so on. However, when working with functions in
TypeScript, we have to keep *data types* in mind.

## Declaring Functions

### Named Functions

Let\'s take a look at a TypeScript function declaration.

::: admonition
Example

We want to declare a function called `myFunction`. `myFunction` has one
parameter, a number called `x`. `myFunction` returns the value of `x`
multiplied by 2.

With this in mind, the declaration in TypeScript would look like:

``` typescript
function myFunction(x: number): number {
   return x*2;
}
```

Here you can see that we provided the type of the parameter and the type
of the value that is returned after the colons. If `x` were a string or
a boolean, then we would replace `number` with the data type of `x`.
:::

What if the function doesn\'t return a value? In these cases, we use
`void` as the return type.

::: admonition
Example

Let\'s change up `myFunction` a little bit! `myFunction` still has one
parameter, our number called `x`, however, it doesn\'t return a specific
value.

``` typescript
let y: number = 0;

function myFunction(x: number): void {
   y = x*2;
}
```

Instead of returning the value of `x` multiplied by 2, `myFunction` now
assigns the value of `x` multiplied by 2 to another variable, `y`. We
can now use `void` to specify that no value is returned.
:::

### Anonymous Functions

For an anonymous function, you still need to provide types for the value
returned and the parameters.

::: admonition
Example

Now we want to declare an anonymous function, `myFunction`, which has
one parameter, a number called `x`, and returns the value of `x`
multiplied by 2.

``` typescript
let myFunction = function(x: number): number { return x*2; };
```
:::

Just as we did above with the named function, we need to make sure that
we include the data type for the parameters and the return type of the
function.

## Optional Parameter

When declaring a function in TypeScript, you may make some of your
parameters optional. This means that when you are calling the function,
you can leave off the optional parameter(s).

To denote a parameter as optional, we use the `?` notation. Any
parameters that are optional must follow the required parameters.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.typescript linenos=""}
function myFunction(a: number, b?:number): number {
    if (typeof b !== 'undefined'){
        return a+b+5;
     } else {
         return a+5;
     }
 }

console.log(myFunction(1,2));
console.log(myFunction(1));
console.log(myFunction(3,5));
console.log(myFunction(3));
```

In this example, the `myFunction` function has two parameters, `a` and
`b`. `a` is required and `b` is optional. When both arguments are
provided, then the sum of the 2 arguments and 5 is returned. When only
one argument is provided to the function, then the value of `a+5` is
returned.

Another way to deal with a parameter you need to be optional is to give
it a default value.

Let\'s say that in the example above, we wanted to give `b` a default
value of 5. That way, if no argument is supplied for `b`, then the value
returned is that of `a+10`.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.typescript linenos=""}
function myFunction(a: number, b = 5): number {
   return a+b+5;
}

console.log(myFunction(1,2));
console.log(myFunction(1));
console.log(myFunction(3,5));
console.log(myFunction(3));      
```

:::

Because `b` has a default value of `5`, when the user does not pass a
value to the second argument of `myFunction`, 5 is used as the value of
`b`.

## Check Your Understanding

::: admonition
Question

What is wrong with this function declaration? NOTE there are at least 3
things that should be changed.

``` typescript
let myFunction = function(a:number,b? = 3) {return a*b};
```
