# Why TypeScript?

! statically typed language, ! dynamically typed language

The final chapters of the first unit cover a framework called Angular.
Angular runs on TypeScript for a couple of reasons.

First, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This means that you can
write JavaScript code and use it in TypeScript files.

Second, TypeScript is a **statically typed language**. A statically
typed language is a language where the type of a variable is given at
the time the program is compiled. This is often achieved by adding the
type of the variable to the variable declaration. However, this is not
what we have been doing so far. JavaScript is a **dynamically typed
language**. In a dynamically typed language, the type of the variable is
determined at runtime and is based on the value inside the variable, not
the variable declaration.

Statically typed languages are considered by many to be more stable and
less prone to production errors, because the errors will occur in
development.

## Set Up Your Local Development Environment

As we continue to shift away from online work in repl.it to *local*
development on your computer, you need to install some specific
software.

1.  If you have not already done so, download and install
    `Visual Studio Code <vsc-install>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} on
    your machine.
2.  `Install Node on your computer <node-install>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, which also installs the NPM Command Line Interface
    (CLI). We discussed this briefly in the
    `Modules <npm-cli>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} chapter.

The NPM CLI tool provides you with an efficient and deliberate way to
install other software and modules onto your computer. As you proceed
through the next four chapters, you will use the NPM CLI in the terminal
to perform these installations.
