# Declaring and Using Variables

Since TypeScript is statically typed, the type of value is added to the
variable declaration. However, we will still use our `let` and `const`
keywords where appropriate.

The general format of a variable declaration is:

``` js
let variableName: type = value;
```

## `number`

When declaring a variable and using the `number` type, we add `number`
to the variable declaration, like so:

``` js
let variableName: number = 10;
```

## `string`

When declaring a `string`, we want to use the `string` keyword.

``` js
let variableName: string = "10";
```

## `boolean`

The `boolean` keyword should be used when declaring a variable of the
`boolean` type.

``` js
let variableName: boolean = true;
```

## Examples

Let\'s use some familiar variable declarations to compare between what
we know how to do in JavaScript and what we are now learning about
TypeScript.

``` {.js linenos=""}
// In JavaScript, we have:

let spaceShuttleName = "Determination";
let shuttleSpeed = 17500;
let distancetoMars = 225000000;
let distancetoMoon = 384400;
let milesperKilometer = 0.621;

// The same declarations in TypeScript would be:

let spaceShuttleName: string = "Determination";
let shuttleSpeed: number = 17500;
let distancetoMars: number = 225000000;
let distancetoMoon: number = 384400;
let milesperKilometer: number = 0.621;
```

Question

The correct declaration of the variable, `astronautName`, that holds the
value, `"Sally Ride"`, is:

a.  `let astronautName = "Sally Ride";`
b.  `let astronautName = string: "Sally Ride";`
c.  `let astronautName: string = "Sally Ride";`
d.  `string astronautName = "Sally Ride";`
