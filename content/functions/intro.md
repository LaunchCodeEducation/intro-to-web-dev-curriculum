# Introduction

You have been using functions throughout your learning so far, without
receiving a full explanation of how functions work. This chapter focuses
explicitly on the details of how functions work, how they can be used,
and how you can create functions of your own.

A **function** is a reusable, callable piece of code. Like variables,
functions often have names (though the next chapter shows us that we can
create functions without names).

You have already become familiar with several functions:

-   `console.log`
-   The type conversion functions: `Number`, `String`, and `Boolean`
-   String and array methods, such as `indexOf`

Note

When learning about strings and arrays, we noted that a **method** is a
function that \"belongs to\" an object. This distinction is important to
keep in mind, and will be explored in depth in a later chapter. For now,
think of a method as a *special type* of function.
:::

Each of the functions we have used works in the same way. By typing the
function\'s name, followed by parentheses, we can *call* the function,
resulting in an action being carried out. Sometimes, as with
`console.log`, we can provide input data between the parentheses, which
the function will use to carry out its action.

::: admonition
Example

The function `console.log` prints the provided value or values (the
input data).

``` js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

**Console Output**

    Hello, World!
:::

This is an example of a function receiving *input*. Functions may also
provide *output*. For example, the type conversion functions give back
the result of converting a value.

::: admonition
Example

Type conversion functions *return* a value, that can be used by the
calling code. Often, we store the return value of a function in a
variable.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let num = Number("42");
console.log("The variable num is of type", typeof num, "and has value", num);
```

**Console Output**

    The variable num is of type number and has value 42

::: admonition
Example

Many array and string methods also return values. This program uses the
string method `split` to break a string into separate components.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let commaSeparatedValues = "Smith,Jane,100 Cherry Blossom Lane";
let values = commaSeparatedValues.split(',');
console.log(values);
```

**Console Output**

    [ 'Smith', 'Jane', '100 Cherry Blossom Lane' ]

encapsulation
:::

Functions are extremely powerful. They allow us to repeat actions
without repeating each individual step of code that the actions are
built from. By grouping actions together, functions allow us to be
removed from the details of what they are actually doing.

When we want to print a message to the console using `console.log`, we
don\'t have to know what the console is, or how a string can be
displayed on it. The behavior is wrapped up within the function itself.
This is an example of a broader programming concept known as
**encapsulation**. Encapsulation is the process of packaging up code in
a reusable way, without the programmer needing to be concerned with how
it works.

::: index
single: function; machine
:::

::: {#function-machine}
A commonly-used analogy for describing the concept of a function is that
of a machine that takes input, carries out an action, and gives back a
result. This is known as the **function machine** analogy.
:::

<figcaption>The function machine</figcaption>
</figure>

If we want to use a function, we must provide it with some input. It
carries out an action on that input and returns a result. The action
occurs within the function, or \"inside the machine\". If we know the
purpose of a function, we simply provide it with input and receive the
output. The rest is up to the machine itself.

Note
:::

You may notice that a function like `console.log` doesn\'t seem to
return anything. We will soon learn that *every* function returns a
value, regardless of whether or not that value is used, or is even
useful.
:::

The programming concept of a function is very similar to the concept of
a mathematical function. For example, in high school algebra you learned
about functions like `y = 4x + 7`. These functions used a mathematical
input (`x`) and carried out a procedure to return a numerical result
(`y`).

::: admonition
Example

Consider the following mathematical function:

    f(x) = x² + 4x - 2

We can *call* the function by giving it a specific *input*:

    f(3) = 3² + 4*3 - 2 = 9 + 12 - 2 = 19

The number 19 is the *output*.
:::

Functions also allow us to keep our code DRY, a concept that you learned
about `when we introduced loops <dry-code>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. If we want to do the same basic task 17 times across a
program, we can reduce code repetition by writing one function and
calling it 17 times.
