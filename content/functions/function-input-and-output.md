# Function Input and Output

In the introduction to this chapter, we used the metaphor of the
`function machine <function-machine>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
noting that the machine takes *input* and provides *output*. This
section focuses on the details of these two aspects of function
behavior.

## Return Statements

::: index
single: return single: return; value
:::

Some functions return values that are useful. In particular, the type
conversion functions convert input to the specified data type and return
the result\-\--calling `Number("3.14")` returns the value `3.14`.

### Returning a Value

To return a value from functions that *we* create, we can use a **return
statement**. A return statement has the form:

``` js
return someVal;
```

where `someVal` is any value.

::: admonition
Example

This function has a single parameter, `n`, which is expected to be a
positive integer. It returns the sum 1+2+\...+n.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function sumToN(n) {
   let sum = 0;
   for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
      sum += i;
   }
   return sum;
}

console.log(sumToN(3));
```

**Console Output**

    6
:::

Notice that `sumToN` does not print anything; the output comes from the
final line of the program, which prints the value *returned by* the
function call `sumToN(3)`.

Now that we have return statements in our coding toolbox, we will very
rarely print anything *within* a function. If we want to see the value
returned by a function then we must print it *after* calling the
function.

::: admonition
Question

The function `sumToN` uses a pattern that we have seen previously. What
is it called?
:::

### Using `return` is Optional

As we saw with our initial examples of function definitions, not every
function explicitly returns a value. At its simplest, a function can
even have an empty body.

``` js
function doNothing() {}
```

As written, this function is completely valid, but useless. Although the
function doesn\'t have a `return` statement, JavaScript still implicitly
returns a value.

::: admonition
Example

A function without a `return` statement returns the special value
`undefined`.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function doNothing() {}

let returnVal = doNothing();
console.log(returnVal);
```

**Console Output**

    undefined
:::

### `return` Terminates Function Execution

When a return statement executes, the function terminates, regardless of
whether or not there is any code following the return statement. This
means that you must be careful to use `return` only when the work of the
function has been completed.

::: admonition
Example

This `console.log` statement in this function never executes, since the
function returns before it is reached.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function pastThePointOfReturn() {
   return "I'm done!";
   console.log("This will not be printed");
}

console.log(pastThePointOfReturn());
```

**Console Output**

    I'm done!
:::

We can use the fact that `return` stops the execution of a function
intentionally, to force a function to stop execution.

::: admonition
Example

This function prints out the integers 1\...n using an infinite `while`
loop, which nonetheless terminates when the `return` statement is
executed.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function countToN(n) {
   let count = 1;
   while (true) {
      if (count > n) {
         return;
      }
      console.log(count);
      count++;
   }
}
```
:::

### Boolean Functions

::: index
pair: function; boolean
:::

A function that returns a boolean value is known as a **boolean
function**. Perhaps the simplest such function is one that tests an
integer to determine if it is even.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
function isEven(n) {
   if (n % 2 === 0) {
      return true;
   } else {
      return false;
   }
}

console.log(isEven(4));
console.log(isEven(7));
```

**Console Output**

    true
    false
:::

It is conventional to name boolean functions by starting with either
`is` or `has`, which creates a nice semantic effect when reading the
code. For example, reading `isEven(4)` communicates to the reader that
the function should answer the question, \"Is 4 even?\" This is a
convention so widely used by programmers that it extends to nearly every
language.

Let\'s return to the `isEven` function above, to see how we can use the
power of return statements to make it even better.

Since `return` terminates the function, we can leave out the `else`
clause and have the same effect. This is because if `n` is even, the
return statement in the `if` block will execute and the function will
end. If `n` is odd, the `if` block will be skipped and the second return
statement will execute.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function isEven(n) {
   if (n % 2 === 0) {
      return true;
   }
   return false;
}
```

This updated version works exactly the same as our initial function.

Additionally, notice that the function returns `true` when `n % 2 === 0`
returns `true`, and it returns `false` when `n % 2 === 0` returns
`false`. In other words, the return value is *exactly the same* as the
value of `n % 2 === 0`. This means that we can simplify the function
even further by returning the value of this expression.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function isEven(n) {
   return n % 2 === 0;
}
```

This version of `isEven` is better than the first two, not because it is
shorter (shorter isn\'t always better), but because it is simpler to
read. We don\'t have to break down the conditional logic to see what is
being returned.

Most boolean functions can be written so that they return the value of a
boolean expression, rather than explicitly returning `true` or `false`.

## Parameters and Arguments

::: index
single: function; argument single: function; parameter
:::

Over the past few sections, we introduced two function-related concepts
that are very similar, and are often confusing to distinguish:
*arguments* and *parameters*. The difference between the two is subtle,
so we will attempt to clear that up now.

The easiest way to talk about the difference between arguments and
parameters is by referring to an example.

::: admonition
Example

The function `hello` takes a single value, which we expect to be a
person\'s name, and returns a message that greets that person.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function hello(name) {
   return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(hello("Lamar"));
```

**Console Output**

    Hello, Lamar!
:::

In this example, `name` is a **parameter**. It is part of the function
definition, and *behaves like a variable* that exists only within the
function.

The value `"Lamar"` that is used when we invoke the function on line 5
is an **argument**. It is a *specific value* that is used during the
function call.

The difference between a parameter and an argument is the same as that
between a variable and a value. A variable *refers to* a specific value,
just like a parameter *refers to* a specific argument when a function is
called. Like a value, an argument is a concrete piece of data.

## Arguments Are Optional

A function may be defined with several parameters, or with no parameters
at all. Even if a function is defined with parameters, JavaScript will
not complain if the function is called *without* specifying the value of
each parameter.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
function hello(name) {
   return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(hello());
```

**Console Output**

    Hello, undefined!
:::

We defined `hello` to have one parameter, `name`. When calling it,
however, we did not provide any arguments. Regardless, the program ran
without error.

*Arguments are optional* when calling a function. When a function is
called without specifying a full set of arguments, any parameters that
are left without values will have the value `undefined`.

::: index
single: function; default parameter
:::

If your function will not work properly without one or more of its
parameters defined, then you should define a **default value** for these
parameters. The default value can be provided next to the parameter
name, after `=`.

::: admonition
Example

This example modifies the `hello` function to use a default value for
`name`. If `name` is not defined when `hello` is called, it will use the
default value.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function hello(name = "World") {
   return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(hello());
console.log(hello("Lamar"));
```

**Console Output**

    Hello, World!
    Hello, Lamar!
:::

While this may seem new, we have already seen a function that allows for
some arguments to be omitted\-\--the string method `slice`.

::: admonition
Example

The string method `slice` allows the second argument to be left off.
When this happens, the method behaves as if the value of the second
argument is the length of the string.

``` {.js linenos=""}
// returns "Launch"
"LaunchCode".slice(0, 6);

// returns "Code"
"LaunchCode".slice(6);

// also returns "Code"
"LaunchCode".slice(6, 10);
```
:::

Just as it is possible to call a function with *fewer* arguments than it
has parameters, we can also call a function with *more* arguments than
it has parameters. In this case, such parameters are not available as a
named variable.

::: admonition
Example

This example calls `hello` with two arguments, even though it is defined
with only one parameter.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function hello(name = "World") {
   return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(hello("Jim", "McKelvey"));
```

**Console Output**

    Hello, Jim!
:::

::: admonition
Fun Fact

These \"extra\" arguments can still be accessed using a special object
named `arguments`, which is made available to every function. If you are
curious, [read more at
MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments).
However, we will not need to use this advanced JavaScript feature in
this course.
