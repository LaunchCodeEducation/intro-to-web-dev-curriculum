# Studio: Functions

The `reverse` method flips the order of the elements within an array.
However, `reverse` does not affect the digits or characters within those
elements.

Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let arr = ['hello', 'world', 123, 'orange'];

arr.reverse()
console.log(arr);
```

**Console Output**

    ['orange', 123, 'world', 'hello']
:::

What if we wanted the reversed array to be
`['egnaro', 321, 'dlrow', 'olleh']`?

Let\'s have some fun by creating a process that reverses BOTH the order
of the entries in an array AND the order of characters within the
individual elements.

Remember that a function should perform only one task. To follow this
best practice, we will solve the array reversal by defining two
functions - one that reverses the characters in a string (or the digits
in a number) and one that flips the order of entries in the array.

## Reverse Characters

1.  In the *composing functions* section, we examined a function that
    `reverses the characters in a string <reverse-a-string>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} using the `split` and `join` methods. Let\'s rebuild
    that function now.
    a.  Define the function as `reverseCharacters`. Give it one
        parameter, which will be the string to reverse.
    b.  Within the function, `split` the string into an array, then
        reverse the array.
    c.  Use `join` to create the reversed string and *return* that
        string from the function.
    d.  Below the function, define and initialize a variable to hold a
        string.
    e.  Use `console.log(reverseCharacters(myVariableName));` to call
        the function and verify that it correctly reverses the
        characters in the string.
    f.  *Optional*: Use method chaining to reduce the lines of code
        within the function.

Tip

Use these sample strings for testing:

a.  `'apple'`
b.  `'LC101'`
c.  `'Capitalized Letters'`
d.  `'I love the smell of code in the morning.'`
:::

## Reverse Digits

2.  The `reverseCharacters` function works great on strings, but what if
    the argument passed to the function is a number? Using
    `console.log(reverseCharacters(1234));` results in an error, since
    `split` only works on strings (TRY IT). When passed a number, we
    want the function to return a number with all the digits reversed
    (e.g. 1234 converts to 4321 and NOT the string `"4321"`).
    a.  Add an `if` statement to `reverseCharacters` to check the
        `typeof` the parameter.
    b.  If `typeof` is \'string\', return the reversed string as before.
    c.  If `typeof` is \'number\', convert the parameter to a string,
        reverse the characters, then convert it back into a number.
    d.  Return the reversed number.
    e.  Be sure to print the result returned by the function to verify
        that your code works for *both strings and numbers*. Do this
        before moving on to the next exercise.

## Complete Reversal

3.  Now we are ready to finish our complete reversal process. Create a
    new function with one parameter, which is the array we want to
    change. The function should:
    a.  Define and initialize an empty array.
    b.  Loop through the old array.
    c.  For each element in the old array, call `reverseCharacters` to
        flip the characters or digits.
    d.  Add the reversed string (or number) to the array defined in part
        \'a\'.
    e.  Return the final, reversed array.
    f.  *Be sure to print the results from each test case in order to
        verify your code*.

  `['hello', 'world', 123, 'orange']`          `['egnaro', 321, 'dlrow', 'olleh']`

## Bonus Missions

4.  Define a function with one parameter, which will be a string. The
    function must do the following:
    a.  Have a clear, descriptive name like `funPhrase`.
    b.  Retrieve only the last character from strings with lengths of 3
        or less.
    c.  Retrieve only the first 3 characters from strings with lengths
        larger than 3.
    d.  Use a template literal to return the phrase
        `We put the '___' in '___'.` Fill the first blank with the
        modified string, and fill the second blank with the original
        string.
    e.  [Build your function at
        repl.it](https://repl.it/@launchcode/FunctionsExercises01).
5.  Now test your function:
    f.  Outside of the function, define the variable `str` and
        initialize it with a string (e.g. `'Functions rock!'`).
    g.  Call your function and print the returned phrase.
6.  The area of a rectangle is equal to its *length x width*.
    a.  Define a function with the required parameters to calculate the
        area of a rectangle.
    b.  The function should *return* the area, NOT print it.
    c.  Call your area function by passing in two arguments - the length
        and width.
    d.  If only one argument is passed to the function, then the shape
        is a square. Modify your code to deal with this case.
    e.  Use a template literal to print, \"The area is \_\_\_\_ cm\^2.\"
    f.  [Code the area function at
        repl.it](https://repl.it/@launchcode/FunctionsExercises02).

Tip

Use these test cases.

a.  length = 2, width = 4 (area = 8)
b.  length = 14, width = 7 (area = 98)
c.  length = 20 (area = 400)
