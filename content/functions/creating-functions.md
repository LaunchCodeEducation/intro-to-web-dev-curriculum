# Creating Functions

While using the functions built into JavaScript is useful, the most
powerful aspect of functions is the ability of programmers to create
their own.

::: index

named
:::

There are several ways to define functions in JavaScript. We will
introduce one technique in this chapter and a second technique in the
next.

## Function Syntax

To create a function, use the following syntax:

``` {.js linenos=""}
function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2,..., parameterN) {

   // function body

}
```

::: index
single: function; keyword
:::

Here, `function` is a keyword that instructs JavaScript to create a new
function using the definition that follows. Since `function` is a
keyword, it may not be used elsewhere, for example as the name of a
variable.

::: index
single: function; name
:::

Following `function` is the **function name**, which is `myFunction` in
the generic example above. The function name is determined by you, the
programmer, and should therefore follow best practices. In particular,
function names should use camel case and have descriptive names. We will
have more to say about naming functions near the end of this chapter.

::: index
single: function; parameter
:::

Following the function name, we define **parameters** within the
parentheses. Think of parameters as variables that can be used only
within the function itself. The number and names of the parameters are
determined by the programmer, based on what they want the function to
do. A function may be defined with several parameters, or no parameters
at all.

TypeScript

Note
:::

Many programming languages require you to state which data type each
parameter should be (for example, string or number). In such languages,
if you try to call a function with a parameter of incorrect type, an
error results.
:::

JavaScript *does not* allow you to specify the types of parameters,
though the JavaScript extension TypeScript does. We will learn a bit of
TypeScript later on.

After the parameters and closing parenthesis, within curly brackets,
`{ }`, is the **function body**. This is where the actions that the
function should carry out are defined. The function body can consist of
any amount of code.

### An Example

Let\'s see function syntax in action. We first consider a program that
prints an array of names.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let names = ["Lena", "James", "Julio"];

for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
   console.log(names[i]);
}
```

Following this pattern, we can create a function that prints *any* array
of names.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function printNames(names) {
   for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
      console.log(names[i]);
   }
}
```

Breaking down the components of a function using our new terminology
gives us:

-   **Function name**: `printNames`
-   **Parameter(s)**: `names`
-   **Body**:

``` {.js linenos=""}
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
   console.log(names[i]);
}
```

Notice that there is nothing about this function that forces `names` to
actually contain names, or even strings. The function will work the same
for any array it is given. Therefore, a better name for this function
would be `printArray`.

Our function can be used the same way as each of the built-in functions,
such as `console.log`, by calling it. Remember that calling a function
triggers its actions to be carried out.

``` {.js linenos=""}
function printArray(names) {
   for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
      console.log(names[i]);
   }
}

printArray(["Lena", "James", "Julio"]);
console.log("---");
printArray(["orange", "apple", "pear"]);
```

**Console Output**

    Lena
    James
    Julio
    ---
    orange
    apple
    pear

::: index
! abstraction
:::

This example illustrates how functions allow us to make our code
**abstract**. Abstraction is the process of taking something specific
and making it more general. In this example, a loop that prints the
contents of a specific array variable (something specific) is
transformed into a function that prints the contents of *any* array
(something general).

## Defining and Calling

When we define a function, we are making it available for later use. The
function does not execute when it is defined; it must be *called* in
order to execute. This is not only a common point of confusion for new
programmers, but can also be the source of logic errors in programs.

Let\'s see how this works explicitly.

::: admonition
Try It!

What happens if we define a function without calling it?

::: {.replit linenos="" slug="Function-Definition"}
js

function sayHello() {

:   console.log(\"Hello, World!\");

}

Question

What is printed when this program runs?
:::

In order for a function to run, it must be explicitly *called*.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
function sayHello() {
   console.log("Hello, World!");
}

sayHello();
```

**Console Output**

    Hello, World!
