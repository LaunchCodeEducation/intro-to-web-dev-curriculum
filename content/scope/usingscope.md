# Using Scope

Scope allows programmers to control the flow of information through the
variables in their program. Some variables you want to set as constants
(like pi), which can be accessed globally. Others you want to keep
secure to minimize the danger of accidental updates. For example, a
variable holding someone\'s username should be kept secure.

## Shadowing

::: index
! variable shadowing, ! shadowing
:::

**Variable shadowing** is where two variables in different scopes have
the same name. The variables can then be accessed under different
contexts. However, shadowing can affect the variable\'s accessibility.
It also causes confusion for anyone reviewing the code.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.JavaScript linenos=""}
const input = require('readline-sync');

function hello(name) {
   console.log('Hello,', name);
   name = 'Ruth';
   return doubleName(name);
}

function doubleName(name){
   console.log(name+name);
   return name+name;
}

let name = input.question("Please enter your name: ");

hello(name);
doubleName(name);
console.log(name);
```

So, what is the value of `name` in line 4, 10, 16, 17, and 18?
:::

Yikes! This is why shadowing is NOT a best practice in coding. Whenever
possible, use different global and local variable names.

::: admonition
Try It!

If you are curious about the `name` values in the example, feel free to
run the code [here](https://repl.it/@launchcode/ShadowingExample).

## Variable Hoisting

::: index
! variable hoisting
:::

**Variable hoisting** is a behavior in JavaScript where variable
declarations are raised to the top of the current scope. This results in
a program being able to use a variable before it has been declared.
Hoisting occurs when the `var` keyword is used in the declaration, but
it does NOT occur when `let` and `const` are used in the declaration.

::: admonition
Note

Although we don\'t use the `var` keyword in this book, you will see it a
lot in other JavaScript resources. Variable hoisting is an important
concept to keep in mind as you work with JavaScript.

## Check Your Understanding

::: admonition
Question

What keyword allows a variable to be hoisted?

a.  `let`
b.  `var`
c.  `const`
:::

::: admonition
Question

Consider this code:

``` {.js linenos=""}
let a = 0;

function myFunction() {
   let a = 10;
   return a;
}
```

Because there are two separate variables with the name, `a`, under the
two different scopes, `a` is being shadowed.

a.  True
b.  False
