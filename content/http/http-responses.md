# Responses

::: index
single: HTTP; response
:::

Each HTTP request that reaches a web server results in an HTTP response
to the client.

A generic HTTP response looks like this:

    HTTP/2.0 200 OK
    Date: Wed, 22 May 2019 17:36:50 GMT
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    Content-Length: 8050
    Last-Modified: Wed, 22 May 2019 17:33:45 GMT

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--Rest of HTML page -->
    </html>

The structure has these components:

::: index
single: HTTP; response code single: HTTP; response headers single: HTTP;
response line
:::

1.  **Status line:** The first line of the response is the **response
    line**, which contains status information about the response
    including the **response code**. In this example, the response code
    is 200, which indicates the request was fulfilled successfully.
2.  **Response headers:** Below the response line are the **response
    headers**. Similar to request headers, these are key-value pairs
    that contain metadata about the response.
3.  **Blank line:** This signifies the end of the response headers.
4.  **Response body (Optional):** Below the blank line, the request body
    takes up the remainder of the HTTP response. This is usually HTML,
    CSS, JavaScript, etc.

## Response Codes

HTTP **response codes** are standardized codes that servers use to
convey the result of attempting to fulfill the client\'s request. They
are always three-digit numbers that fall into one of five categories
based on the first digit.

-   1xx (Informational): The request was received but processing has not
    finished
-   2xx (Successful): The request was valid and the server successfully
    responded
-   3xx (Redirection): The client should go elsewhere to access the
    requested resource
-   4xx (Client Error): There was a problem with the client\'s request
-   5xx (Server Error): The client\'s request was valid, but the server
    experienced an error when fulfilling it

Specific codes will have all 3 digits specified, such as 201, 302, or
404. Each specific code has a specific meaning. One of the most commonly
experienced error codes is 404. You have likely encountered a message
like this at some point:

![](figures/404.png){height="250px"}

A 404 response code indicates that the requested resource does not exist
on the server. This can occur when, for example, you make a typo when
typing a URL into the address bar. Referring back to our postal service
analogy, a 404 is similar to receiving a letter marked \"Return to
Sender\" because the addressee doesn\'t live there anymore.

We don\'t expect you to memorize all of the response codes, but you
should be able to quickly recall the most common codes.

  Code   Description                                                                                                         Example
  ------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  200    The requested resource exists and was successfully returned.                                                        Visiting any existing web page on the Internet.
  301    The requested resource has moved, and the client should look for it at the URL included in the `Location` header.   A site moves a page, but wants users with old links to be redirected to the page\'s new location.
  404    The server received the request, but the requested resource does not exist on the server.                           Requesting an image or HTML file that does not exist on the server.
  500    The server experienced an error while fulfilling the request.                                                       The server lost its database connection and cannot retrieve requested data.

## Response Headers

There are [quite a few response
headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Response_fields),
but only a few will be useful to us.

  Header             Purpose                                                              Example
  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
  `Content-Type`     The type of data included in the response body.                      `text/html`, `text/css`, `image/jpg`
  `Content-Length`   The size of the response body in bytes.                              `348`
  `Location`         The URL that the client should visit to find a relocated resource.   `https://www.launchcode.org/new-blog/`

## Response Body

While requests often don\'t have a body, responses almost *always* have
a body. The response body is where the data that a request asked for is
located. It can contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or image data.

When a response is received by a browser, it is loaded into the
browser\'s memory, with additional processing in some cases. For HTML
files, the markup is rendered into a web page. For CSS files, the style
rules are parsed and applied to the given HTML page.

Question

A 404 response indicates that:

1.  The server is offline.
2.  The user needs to log in.
3.  The requested resource does not exist.
4.  The server\'s database crashed.

Question

Visit [Wikipedia\'s article on HTTP response
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). Which
response code is used to signify that the user must authenticate
themselves (that is, log in) before viewing the given resource?
