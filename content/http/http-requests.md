# Requests

::: index
single: HTTP; request
:::

HTTP requests must conform to the structure outlined by the [World Wide
Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/). We\'ll discuss the most
important and most commonly-used aspects of HTTP request structure.

A generic HTTP request looks like this:

    GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.launchcode.org
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0
    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
    Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
    DNT: 1
    Connection: keep-alive
    Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
    Cache-Control: max-age=0

    Request Body

The structure has these components:

::: index
single: HTTP; request method single: HTTP; request headers
:::

1.  **Request line:** The first line is the request line. It specifies
    the **request method**, path, and HTTP version being used.
2.  **Request headers:** From line 2 until the first blank line,
    **request headers** are included as a series of key-value pairs, one
    per line.
3.  **Blank line:** This signifies the end of the request headers.
4.  **Request body (Optional):** Below the blank line, the request body
    takes up the remainder of the HTTP request.

## Request Methods

The request line is minimal. We have already discussed the path, which
specifies the resource being requested. The first part of the request
line, the request method, is new to us.

A **request method** specifies the type of action to be carried out on
the requested resource. HTTP defines [8
methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods),
of which we will only need to use 2: `GET` and `POST`.

### The `GET` Method

::: index
single: HTTP; GET
:::

Using the `GET` method tells the server that we want to simply
*retrieve* the resource. This is the most commonly used method. It is
used for requests for HTML pages, CSS and JS files, and images. When you
click on a link in a web page, you are triggering a `GET` request for
the linked page.

`GET` requests generally do not have a body, since they are *asking*
rather than *sending* for information.

::: admonition
Example

`GET` requests are usually used for:

-   Loading a page after typing an address into the browser\'s address
    bar
-   Conducting a search via a search engine
-   Loading a page after clicking on a link
:::

### The `POST` Method

::: index
single: HTTP; POST
:::

Using the `POST` method tells the server that we want to *create* new
data on the server. As you will learn in the next chapter, `POST` is
used when submitting a form.

`POST` requests usually have a body, which contains data that the server
processes and stores in some fashion.

::: admonition
Example

Some common situations that use `POST` are:

-   Signing into a web site
-   Sending an email via a web-based email client
-   Making an online purchase
:::

## Headers

There are [quite a few request
headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Request_fields),
but only a few will be useful to us.

  Header           Purpose                                                                                                                  Example
  ---------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `Host`           The domain name or IP address of the server the request should be sent to.                                               `www.launchcode.org`
  `User-Agent`     Information about the client (usually a browser) making the request. The example is for a version of Firefox on a Mac.   `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0`
  `Accept`         The types of data that the client is willing to accept in the response body.                                             `text/html,image/jpeg`
  `Content-Type`   The type of data included in the request body. Usually only used for `POST` requests.                                    `application/json,application/xml`

  : Common HTTP Request Headers

## Body

The optional request body may contain any data whatsoever, though it
often includes form data submitted via a `POST` request. For example,
when signing into a web site, the request body will contain your
username and password. We will later learn that it can contain other
data formats such as XML and JSON.

As mentioned above, `GET` requests generally do *not* have a body.
