Most people use the Internet without fully understanding how it works. Without much trouble, they can open a browser, navigate to a site, and interact with it. They do not need to know precisely *how* the Internet works in order to use it.

For web developers, however, fundamental understanding of the flow of information across the Internet is essential.

## Servers and Clients

The Internet uses the **client-server model**. A **server** is an application that provides resources---such as raw data, web pages, or images. A **client** is an application that requests resources from a server.

When navigating the web, the client is the web browser on your computer or smartphone. When you click on a link or type in an address and hit *Enter*, the client/browser makes a request to a server that sits in a building somewhere out in the world. The server receives the request, and sends a response back to the client. The client then displays the content of the response.

   In the client-server model, the server may sometimes be on the *same* computer as the client. This is often the case when a programmer is building a web application. The in-progress, development version of the application is on their laptop, as is their browser that they use to test the app.

## Protocols

A **protocol** is a standard for communication between computers. Most web communication uses *three* protocols, in fact.

| Protocol | Full Name | Role |
|----------|-----------|------|
| HTTP | Hypertext Transfer Protocol | High-level web communication for transferring files and information, including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, and other media form submissions |
| TCP/IP | Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol | Low-level web communication for transferring small chunks of raw data known as *packets* |
| DNS | Domain Name Service | Translates human-friendly names into server addresses |

A thorough understanding of each of these protocols is well beyond the scope of this class. However, as a web developer it is important you have a general understanding of their roles. Each protocol has a different and critical job in enabling web communication.

### HTTP

**HTTP** is the most important protocol for web developers to understand, which you may have guessed from the title of this chapter. It specifies how requests for common web data---such as HTML files or images---should be structured, as well as responses to such requests. The details of request and response message structure are the topic of the rest of this chapter. 

**HTTPS** refers to the HTTP protocol used with a secure connection. A secure connection encrypts so that it can't be read while in-transit. The data is encrypted by the server/client before being transmitted, and decrypted once it is received by the client/server. The precise details of how such encryption works is beyond the scope of this course. 

### TCP/IP

**TCP/IP** is a low-level protocol that is quite complicated. For our purposes, it is important only to know that TCP/IP is the standard that allows *raw data* to get from one place to another on the Internet. 

When a server sends a file back to a client, that file must physically be sent across a series of network components, including cables, routers, and switches. Files are broken down into *packets*---small chunks of a standard size---that are individually sent from one location to the next, until arriving at their final destination and being reassembled.

   You can think of the Internet as a ["series of tubes."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&v=_cZC67wXUTs) This phrase was used by a U.S. Senator in 2006 and widely mocked. However, we think it's actually a reasonable analogy. TCP/IP allows data to be passed from one tube to another until reaching the final destination.

### DNS

**DNS** is the address book of the Internet. It enables us to use readable and memorable names for servers, such as `www.launchcode.org` or `mail.google.com`. Such names are called **domain names**, and they function as aliases for the actual server addresses.

Every server on the internet has a numerical address known as an **IP address**. When a message is addressed using a domain name, the corresponding IP address must be determined before it can be sent. 

{{% notice blue "Example" "rocket" %}}

   The IP addresses of `www.launchcode.org` and `mail.google.com` are `104.25.127.113` and `172.217.5.229`, respectively.

{{% /notice %}}

The sending computer will attempt to *resolve* the domain name by looking it up on a nameserver. A **nameserver** is a directory of domains and IP addresses, and there are thousands of them on the Internet. Most internet service providers (such as Charter or AT&T) provide DNS servers for their customers to use. Once the sending computer knows the IP address, it can send the request to the correct server.

{{% notice blue "Example" "rocket" %}}

   It's easy to look up the IP address of any domain name using freely-available tools. 

   Use the popular site [MX Toolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx) to look up the IP address of `help.launchcode.org`. Does this site live on the same server as `launchcode.org`?

{{% notice blue "Note" "rocket" %}}

   Every computer uses the special IP address `127.0.0.1` to refer to *itself*. This is known as the **loopback address**, and it often has the alias `localhost`. If you use the loopback address when making a request, the request will be sent to a service on the *same* machine as the client.

## Web Addresses

When a client requests a resource from a server, it does so using a **uniform resource locator (URL)**. URLs are also called **web addresses**.

{{% notice blue "Example" "rocket" %}}

   As a regular user of the Internet, you are already familiar with URLs like these:

   1. `https://www.launchcode.org`
   1. `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clientâ€“server_model`
   1. `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=javascript`

{{% /notice %}}

A URL encodes a lot of information about the request, including *what* is being requested and *where* the request should be sent. URLs are made up of several components, each of which plays a role in enabling both client and server to understand what is being requested.

We will generally work with URLs with this structure:

```console
scheme://host:port/path?query_string
```

The five components of this URL are:

1. Scheme
1. Host
1. Port (optional)
1. Path (optional)
1. Query String (optional)

A properly-formed URL must have these components in the *exact* order shown here. Only scheme and host are required.

Let's look at each of these in detail.

### Scheme

The first portion of every URL specifies the **scheme**. Common schemes are `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `mailto`, and `file`. Most often, the scheme specifies the *protocol* to be used in making a request. For us, this will always be `http` or `https`. If left off, a web browser will insert the scheme http/s for you. 

The scheme is *always* followed by `://`.

### Host

The **host** portion of a URL specifies *where* the request should be sent. The host can be either an IP address, like `104.25.128.113`, or a domain name, like `www.launchcode.org`.

### Port

Following the host is an optional **port** number. While the host determines the *server* that the request should be sent to, the port determines the specific *application* on the server that should handle the request. This is important because a single server may run several applications capable of handling requests.

Conventionally, a given type of application will always use the same port, though this is not a hard rule. For example, web servers typically use port 80 or 443, for regular and encrypted messages, respectively. On the other hand, MySQL databases typically use port 3306.

{{% notice blue "Example" "rocket" %}}

   Suppose a server at `mydomain.com` is running both a web server and MySQL database server on the standard ports. Requests to `mydomain.com:80` will be given to the web server, while requests to `mydomain:3306` will be given to the database server.

{{% /notice %}}

If a port number is not specified, then a default value based on the scheme is used. When using `http://` the default port is 80. When using `https://` the default port is 443.

### Path

Following the domain and optional port is the **path**, which consists of a series of names separated by `/`. The path provides information that tells the server *what* is being requested. It can consist of a series of names, such as `/blog/entries/2018/`, or it can end with an explicit file name, such as `/blog/index.html`.

{{% notice blue "Example" "rocket" %}}

   A request to `https://www.launchcode.org/blog/` asks for the resource that lives at the path `/blog/` on the server `www.launchcode.org`. This resource happens to be the homepage of the LaunchCode blog.

   A request to the (very long) URL below asks for the LaunchCode logo, which lives at the path `/assets/dabomb-2080d6e...57f.svg` (truncated here for space).

   ```console
   https://www.launchcode.org/assets/dabomb-2080d6e23ef41463553f203daaa15991fd4c812676d0b098243b4941fcf4b57f.svg
   ```

{{% /notice %}}

If a path is not specified, then the **root path** `/` is used. The root path typically refers to the home page for a given site.

### Query String

Following the path is an optional **query string**, which begins with `?` and contains a set of key-value pairs. Each pair is joined by `=` and is separated from the other pairs by `&`. For example, the query string of a [search on duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=launchcode&atb=v167-5__&ia=web) looks like this:

```console
?q=launchcode&atb=v167-5__&ia=web
```

This query string has *three* key-value pairs:

1. `q` : `launchcode`
1. `atb` : `v167-5__`
1. `ia` : `web`

Notice that these pairs are separated by `&` in the query string.

While the path specifies *what* the request is asking for, the query string provides additional data that may be needed to fulfill the request. As an analogy, you can think of the path like a function name, and the query string as the function arguments.

## Putting It All Together

We just covered a *lot* of information! While these nuts-and-bolts details are important, they aren't nearly as important as the high-level picture of how we access resources on the internet.

To tie these ideas together, watch these two videos on URLs and the Internet as a whole:

## Check Your Understanding

{{% notice green "Question" "rocket" %}}

   Which protocol is responsible for turning a name like `launchcode.org` into a server address?

{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice green "Question" "rocket" %}}

   Why is this URL malformed?

   ```console
   https://launchcode.org?city=miami/lc101
   ```

   1. It uses HTTPS when it should use HTTP.
   1. It doesn't contain a fragment.
   1. It doesn't contain a port.
   1. The query string comes before the path.
