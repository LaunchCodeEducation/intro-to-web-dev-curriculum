# Data Binding

In the previous two Angular lessons, you *stored* data in a
`component.ts` file, and then *displayed* that data in a
`component.html` file.

Example

Assign a `listHeading` variable and a `movies` array in the
`movie-list.component.ts` file:

``` {.typescript linenos=""}
export class MovieListComponent implements OnInit {
   listHeading: string = "Oscar Winners to Watch";
   movies: string[] = ['Titanic', 'Gladiator', 'Mutiny on the Bounty', 'The Silence of the Lambs'];

   constructor() { }

   ngOnInit() { }

}
```

Display the list heading and the titles from the `movies` array using
the `movie-list.component.html` file:

``` {.html+ng2 linenos=""}
<div class='movies'>
   <h3>{{listHeading}}</h3>
   <ol>
      <li *ngFor = 'let movie of movies'>{{movie}}</li>
   </ol>
</div>
```

! data binding, ! view

Each Angular component contains an HTML file that organizes the content
users see in their web browsers. We call these files the **view**.

**Data binding** refers to the technique of linking information
contained in a file to the view. In the example above, data contained in
the `movie-list.component.ts` file is *bound* to placeholders in the
`movie-list.component.html` file.

By binding `listHeading` and `movies`, we tell Angular to watch them for
changes. Whenever the variables in `movie-list.component.ts` change in
value, Angular responds by automatically updating the HTML file.

Data binding is a powerful technique, since it allows developers to
focus on the fun part of the code rather than dealing with all the
nitty-gritty
\"ugh-I-need-to-add-statements-here-here-and-here-to-refresh-the-page\".

Fortunately, you already experienced setting up data binding in Angular,
so the groundwork is done. In this chapter, we will continue practicing
the skill, add in the vocabulary, and explore some refinements.
