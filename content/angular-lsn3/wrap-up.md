# Angular Wrap-Up

Over the past three chapters, you have learned:

1.  What *templates* are and why we want to use them,
2.  How to use the Angular CLI to create a new project, generate new
    components, and run a project locally in your web browser.
3.  How to define custom HTML tags and use them to arrange components
    within a template.
4.  How to use the *structural directives* `*ngFor` and `*ngIf` to
    automatically generate HTML elements and display dynamic content.
5.  How to catch events and set up data-binding to make your web page
    respond to user actions.
6.  How to use *attribute directives* to modify the appearance and
    behavior of specific HTML elements.

## Tip of the Iceberg

The Angular skills you learned are a small slice of what the framework
can accomplish. They provide a solid foundation if you choose to learn
more on your own.

Of course, practice makes better. The best way for you to get better at
Angular is to use Angular. Adapt the examples, exercises, and studio
projects however you want. Also, create your own project and build your
own sample web pages. Create an interactive family photo page, a grocery
list, a web based breakout box, or whatever you want.

You can find full documentation on the [Angular.io](https://angular.io/)
website. A good \"next step\" for your Angular learning would be to
complete the [Tour of Heros](https://angular.io/tutorial) tutorial.

Note

The Angular documentation is excruciatingly complete, but do not be
intimidated. There are plenty of separate tutorial sites that cover
individual skills and techniques. When you find an interesting topic on
the Angular site, feel free to Google that topic and explore how other
coders explain how to use it.

### Two Topics to Consider

In this chapter, we discussed *one-way* data binding. As the name
suggests, *two-way* binding exists as well. We chose not to explore this
idea because one-way tasks are more flexible and more frequently used.
However, two-way binding can come in handy if you want data from an
`input` element to automatically change a variable in the `.ts` file.

A much larger idea involves passing data between different components in
the same template. Passing data from a parent component to its children,
from a child to the parent, or between children is VERY useful.
Unfortunately, that topic is beyond the scope of these lessons.

Try Googling \"Passing data between Angular components\", and explore
several of the most recent results. Find one that best suits your
learning style, and then create a simple template that includes
parent-child communication. Also, the *Tour of Heros* tutorial uses
component to component communication.

If your future coding job involves Angular, you will most likely need to
learn the skill.

## Components Should Be Re-used

Recall that at their best, functions accomplish only ONE task. This
makes them re-usable within the same program, or as a module accessible
by many different programs. Components should behave in a similar
manner. Each one should do just one simple thing and should be flexible
enough to work within many different templates.

The real power of a front end framework comes when you view components
as reusable elements. With time and practice, you will build a
collection of small, generic components. You can then combine these
tools in different ways to build small or large sections of any new
project. The Lego analogy works here\-\--the same set of blocks can be
combined in multiple ways to produce different outcomes. Also, if you
need consistent results on multiple web pages, then you just put the
components together the same way each time instead of writing new code.

For demonstration purposes, some of our examples don\'t use this best
practice and instead include components that serve many purposes. After
you finish the following exercises and studio, consider how you could
split the larger components into smaller, re-usable pieces.
