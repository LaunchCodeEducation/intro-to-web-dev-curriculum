Styling has been provided if you would like to add it to your project.

You can start by importing `styling.css` into the following components:
1. `Banner.jsx`
1. `Table.jsx`
1. `Buttons.jsx`

Inside `Buttons.jsx` update the `<div>` in line 6 so that its `className` is equal to `flex-container`.  

Reminder: This step is optional.
