In Part 2, you’ll get comfortable with using CSS selectors and rules to dictate display, while keeping your styles separate from your content.

## Getting Started
Open a file named `styles.css` in your `html-me-something/` directory.

## Getting to Work
Go ahead and start adding styles in your `styles.css` file!

### Requirements

Your CSS must:

1.  Use [margin](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp) and [padding](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp) to space your elements in a visually pleasing manner.

1. Use at least one of each of the following types of selectors:

   1. [element](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element.php)

   1. [class](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.php)

   1. [id](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_id.php)

1. Follow these rules:

   1. Use the element selector to give the `<body>` element a margin value of 8px and a display type of block.

   1. Give a heading on your page the id of `mainHeading` and use the id selector in `styles.css` to give it a color value of red.

   1. Give a paragraph on your page the id of `testP` and a class name of `funParagraph`. Use the class selector in `styles.css` to give it a color value of green.

### Notes
   1. In order to see any visible change, make sure to link the stylesheet to your main document.

   1. Feel free to check out our [styled example](https://education.launchcode.org/html-me-something/submissions/chrisbay/index.html) to see how we did things. Use “View Source” (by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting _View Source_).

   1. Another thing you might find useful is your browser’s [developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools).

   1. And be sure to use the _Resources_ section below as you go.

## Run Your Tests

write this up 

stage and commit


## Submitting your work
Once you are done with your site and have passed all of your tests, navigate to the Canvas assignment and paste the link to your repo in the submission box and submit! 

## Bonus Mission
If you want to show off your hard work to all your friends, Github has a cool feature called [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that makes this really easy.

Github provides free hosting for any “static” web content (like this project). All you have to do is change a setting on your GitHub repository.

1. In a browser, go to the Github page for your repository.

1. Click on the Settings tab

1. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and enable the GitHub Pages feature by choosing your main branch from the dropdown. Hit Save.

1. In any browser, you should now be able to visit `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/html-me-something` and see your web page!
