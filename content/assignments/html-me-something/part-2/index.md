For Task 2, you’ll get comfortable with using CSS selectors and rules to dictate display, while keeping your styles separate from your content.

## Getting Started
Open the file named `styles.css` in your `html-me-something/` directory.

## Getting to Work
Go ahead and start adding styles in your `styles.css` file!

### Requirements

Your CSS must:

1.  Use [margin](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp) and [padding](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp) to space your elements in a visually pleasing manner.

1. Use at least one of each of the following types of selectors:
   1. [element](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element.php)
   1. [class](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.php)
   1. [id](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_id.php)

1. Follow these rules:

   1. Use the element selector to give the `<body>` element a `margin` value of `8px` and a `display` type of `block`.
   1. Give a heading on your page the `id` of `mainHeading` and use the id selector in `styles.css` to apply a styling of your choosing.
   1. Give a paragraph on your page the id of `testP` and a class name of `funParagraph`. Use the class selector in `styles.css` and give it a styling of your choosing.  

   You will be asked to explain and point out your styling choices to your TA during your code review.  Have fun with creating your assignment.

### Notes
   1. In order to see any visible change, make sure to link the stylesheet to your main document.
   1. Feel free to check out our [styled example](https://education.launchcode.org/html-me-something/submissions/chrisbay/index.html) to see how we did things. Use “View Source” (by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting _View Source_).
   1. Another thing you might find useful is your browser’s [developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools).

   1. And be sure to use the _Resources_ section below as you go.

 Once you finish your adding your stylings, be sure to stage and `commit` your changes.

Now that you have applied your stylings, you are ready to test your work and submit your final project.  Move on over to [Task 3]({{< relref "../part-3/index.md" >}}) to work on these final steps.
