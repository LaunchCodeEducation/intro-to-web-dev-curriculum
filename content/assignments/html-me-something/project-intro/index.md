You’ve learned a bit of HTML and some CSS, but you have likely only used it in bits and pieces so far, adding or modifying content in exercises or pre-existing files. Here, you are going to take another step forward by building an entire page from scratch. You will also get some practice using Git.

There are two parts to this exercise, one focused on HTML and another focused on CSS. HTML makes up the structure and content of web pages, while CSS dictates the visual style.

Best practices dictate that content and style should be kept as separate as possible. To that end, we will build the HTML portion of our page first, and afterwards we will add a few styles with CSS. We do this to avoid using HTML tags to change the general appearance of our page. For example, what if we want all of our main headings to be red? We can either add this style one time in the CSS file, or we must include style="color:red" in EVERY h1 tag. Especially for large websites, CSS provides the best place to control the overall appearance of a page.

## Getting Started
TODO: link to starter code repo
Fork and clone the **Graded Assignment #4: HTML Me Something** repository.

As always, if you need to refer back to a guide, check out [Assignment 0]({{< relref "../../hello-world/_index.md" >}}).

## Setup the Project
Open up the directory in Visual Studio Code and start exploring the different files. You will only make changes to `index.html` and `styles.css` so make sure that you don't edit any other files.

## Getting to Work
It’s time to build out your page! Dive into each of the two parts below:

   - [Part 1: HTML]({{< relref "./part-1/index.md" >}})

   - [Part 2: CSS]({{< relref "./part-2/index.md" >}})
