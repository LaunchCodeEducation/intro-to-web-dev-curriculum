## Next Steps: Bonus Mission!
If you want to show off your hard work to all your friends, Github has a cool feature called [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that makes this really easy.

Github provides free hosting for any “static” web content (like this project). All you have to do is change a setting on your GitHub repository.

1. In a browser, go to the Github page for your repository.
1. Click on the Settings tab
1. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and enable the GitHub Pages feature by choosing your `main` branch from the dropdown. Hit Save.
1. In any browser, you should now be able to visit `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/html-me-something` and see your web page!

Remember, Bonus Missions are always optional.
