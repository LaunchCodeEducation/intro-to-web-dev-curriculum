## Running your tests

Now that you have your `index.html` and `styles.css` completed, it's time to run the tests.

In your terminal, make sure you are inside your project directory then run `npm test`.

The tests are looking for the elements required.  If you fail one, look for the message and apply your changes. When they all pass, stage, `commit` and `push` your changes to your repository.

## Submitting your work
Once you are done with your site and have passed all of your tests, navigate to the Canvas assignment and paste the link to your repo in the submission box and submit!
