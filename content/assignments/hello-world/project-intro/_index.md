Your first assignment is mostly an exercise in following instructions. We'll ask you to modify an existing program so that, when run, the program prints "Hello world!".

In order to complete this assignment there are a few things that you will need to have already completed! You can find these items below:

1. [Installed Git]({{< relref "../../../installations/install-git/" >}})
1. [Installed Visual Studio Code]({{< relref "../../../installations/install-visual-studio/" >}})
1. [Installed Node]({{< relref "../../../installations/install-node/" >}})

Programming jobs often require you to get familiar with, or at least make use of, additional technologies. Here, you'll be using a few web applications, like GitHub and Repl.it, to write your code, run it, save it, and submit your assignment.

So while the coding task may appear straightforward, you'll be introduced to a set of instructions, or **workflow**, that is important for the rest of your success in this class.

## Requirements

1. Sign up for a GitHub account.
1. Change the code in Visual Studio Code.
1. Commit the code.
1. Push the code to your assignment repository.
1. Make sure your assignment passes the test.

### GitHub

First, find `Assignment #0` in Canvas and click on the starter code repo link. Fork the repository to your personal profile, copy the repoâ€™s URL for cloning, and clone the project to a directory on your machine.

After you have cloned the directory to your machine, open up the project within `Visual Studio Code` and move on to the next section!
