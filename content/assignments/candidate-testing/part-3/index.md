Finally, calculate the candidate's score and print the results. Look for `TODO 3.2a` and `TODO 3.2b`.  The rest of the steps involve updating code you have written and adding more code. 

Don't remove anything in the file that you haven't written. Doing so may cause your program to behave unexpectedly - and we might not be able to grade it!

**Your task here is to:**

   1. Compare the candidate answers with the correct answers,

   1. Calculate the candidate's score as a percentage,

   1. Convey to the candidate if they have passed the quiz with an 80% or if they have failed.

Some tips:
   1. Checking for the correct answer should be case insensitive (e.g. "Orbit" is the same as "orbit").

   1. `TODO 3.2a` you should see a variable declaration for `grade`. Use this to calculate the candidate's score.   

   1. Below `TODO 3.2b`, calculate the candidate's percentage, using this equation:

      _(Number of Correct Answers) / (Number of Quiz Questions) * 100_
