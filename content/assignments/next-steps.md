## Next Steps

After completing the assignments for this course, you will be ready for the next unit.  In the next unit, you will work with a statically typed language such as Java or C#.  The syntax may vary, but you have been equipped with the skills to complete all of the assignments and projects.  

Great job on completing unit 1!
