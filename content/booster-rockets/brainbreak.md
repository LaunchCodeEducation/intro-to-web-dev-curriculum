## Step Away From Your Code

Sometimes you just need to take a break. When you find yourself getting
frustrated it\'s time to do something else for a bit and come back with
fresh eyes.

Exercise, go for a walk, do the dishes, put on some music and dance,
meditate, set a timer and look up memes (bonus share them with your
peers). Does not matter what you do. By giving your brain a break, often
times when you come back to the code you\'ll have new insight to the
problem that had frustrated you in the first place.
