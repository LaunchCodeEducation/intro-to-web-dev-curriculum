# Working With Arrays

## Bracket Notation and Index

::: index
! index
:::

As previously discussed, arrays are an ordered collection where each
item can be accessed via index. Similar to strings, an **index** in an
array is the number order given to items. Individual items can be
accessed using bracket notation (`array[index]`). Indexes are
zero-based, going from `0` to `array.length-1`.

::: admonition
Example

Use bracket notation and index to access items in an array.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let programmingLanguages = [
   "JavaScript", // index 0
   "Python",     // index 1
   "Java",       // index 2
   "C#"          // index 3
];
console.log(programmingLanguages[0]);
console.log(programmingLanguages[3]);

// What will happen when index 4 is requested?
console.log(programmingLanguages[4]);
```

**Console Output**

    JavaScript
    C#
    undefined
:::

Notice above that `undefined` was printed out when index 4 was
referenced. `undefined` is returned when you request an index that the
array does not contain.

::: index
undefined

Note
:::

**undefined** is a special value in JavaScript that means no value has
been assigned. We will discuss `undefined` more later in the class.

::: admonition
Example

`undefined` will be returned for any index that is outside of the
array\'s index range.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let programmingLanguages = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "C#"];
console.log(programmingLanguages[-1]);
console.log(programmingLanguages[100]);
```

**Console Output**

    undefined

## Arrays are Mutable

::: index
mutable
:::

In programming, mutability refers to what happens when you attempt to
change a value. Remember that strings are immutable, meaning that any
change to a string results in a new string being created. In contrast,
arrays are **mutable**, meaning that individual items in an array can be
edited without a new array being created.

::: admonition
Example

Update an item in an array using bracket notation and index.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let javaScriptFrameworks = ["React", "Angular", "Ember"];
console.log(javaScriptFrameworks);

// Set the value of index 2 to be "Vue"
javaScriptFrameworks[2] = "Vue";

// Notice the value at index 2 is now "Vue"
console.log(javaScriptFrameworks);
```

**Console Output**

    [ 'React', 'Angular', 'Ember' ]
    [ 'React', 'Angular', 'Vue' ]
