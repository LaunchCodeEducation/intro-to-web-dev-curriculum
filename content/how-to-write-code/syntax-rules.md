# Syntax Rules

At their core, programming languages are collections of rules that allow
us to tell a computer what to do. Actions like *Repeat \_\_\_\_ 25
times*, *Prompt the user for a password*, or *Display text on the
screen* can be done with any language. However, each one uses different
methods to complete the tasks.

**Syntax** refers to the structure of a language (spoken, programming,
or otherwise) and the rules about that structure. For example, in
English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with proper
punctuation.

JavaScript and other languages can only run a program if it is
*syntactically correct*, and each language is pretty rigid and
unforgiving if you make a mistake. While humans are good at overlooking
minor grammar and syntax errors, computers cannot do the same.

For example, the following sentence will send English teachers into
fits, *i believe that Catch 22 demon straights a cleer picture of
whirled wor too.* Despite being badly written, we can still make some
sense out of the words. It might take some re-reading, but eventually we
will get the point. Other examples include vanity license plates:

  Plate     Meaning
  --------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  KC ROKS   Kansas City (or Casey?) Rocks
  4EVERL8   All parents who ever needed to get the kids to practice

Computers cannot interpret or overlook mistakes like humans. Any syntax
errors, no matter how minor, will prevent the code from running. Instead
of trying to work around the issue, the program will immediately crash
and generate error messages.
