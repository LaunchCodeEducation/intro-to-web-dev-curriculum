# Comments

As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to
read. Good programmers try to make their code understandable to others,
but it is still tricky to look at a large program and figure out what it
is doing and why.

Best practice encourages us to add notes to our programs, which clearly
explain what the program is doing. These notes are called *comments*.

A **comment** is text within a program intended only for a human
reader\-\--it is completely ignored by the compiler or interpreter. In
JavaScript, the `//` token starts a comment, and the rest of the line
gets ignored. For comments that stretch over multiple lines, the text
falls between the symbols `/*   */`.

Try It

Experiment by adding and removing comments to the code.

::: {.replit slug="CommentExamples01" linenos=""}
js

// This demo shows off comments!

// console.log(\"This does not print.\");

console.log(\"Hello, World!\"); // Comments do not have to start at the
beginning of a line.

/\* Here is how to have multi-line comments. \*/

console.log(\"Comments make your code more readable by others.\");
:::

Notice that when you run the program, it still prints the phrase
`Hello, World`, but none of the comments appear. Also notice the blank
lines left in the code, which are also ignored by the compiler. Comments
and blank lines make your programs much easier for humans to understand.
Use them frequently!
