This textbook will often reference the `javascript-projects` Github repository as you are working your way through. This repository contains code for most, but not all code snippets, exercises, and studios throught the book. However, it does *not* contain any graded assignments.

Before moving on to the next section you will need to `fork` and `clone` the [javascript-projects](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/javascript-projects) repository. You have already completed this same process during the [Your First Program]({{< relref "../../../how-programs-work/reading/your-first-program/index.md" >}}) section of the previous chapter.

## Fork Repository

For a refresher on forking please revisit [this section]({{< relref "../../../how-programs-work/reading/your-first-program/#go-to-github" >}})

Fork the [javascript-projects](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/javascript-projects) repository to your own personal Github account.

## Clone Forked Repository

Open your terminal and clone the forked repository to the desired location.

Depending on how you set up your github account the url you are cloning will look slightly different. Regardless of which method you are using (`HTTPS` or `SSH`) you can find the correct link to copy if you click on the `Code` button within your repository:

### Cloning with HTTPS:

```console
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/javascript-projects.git
```

### Cloning with SSH:

```console
git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/javascript-projects.git
```

## Updates to `javascript-projects` Repository

As mentioned in [this section]({{< relref "../../../how-programs-work/reading/your-first-program/#handling-changes-to-the-original-repo" >}}), there will be occasional updates to the `javascript-projects` repository. That means you will need to update your own forked copy periodically so that you are up to date! Please reference back to the [above mentioned section]({{< relref "../../../how-programs-work/reading/your-first-program/#handling-changes-to-the-original-repo" >}}) anytime you need to do so.

Once you have completed the above steps you are ready to move on!
