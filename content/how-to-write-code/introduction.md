# What is Code?

Computers are dumb, understanding not an ounce of context or intended
meaning. They react mechanically to the instructions we give them, and
they cannot deviate from the steps we tell them to follow.

If our instructions are even the slightest bit off, computers cannot
consider the error and adjust accordingly. Instead, they come to a
grinding halt.

So how do we give computers instructions in the first place? The answer
is to create **code**, which is a set of instructions for a computer to
follow.

## What Code Can Do

Here is a short list of SOME of the tasks we can carry out with code:

1.  Interact with users. Through code, we can ask a user questions,
    store the answers, and respond by changing what is on the screen.
2.  Interact with other systems. Through code, we can interact with
    resources that are outside of our program. For example, we can read
    data in from a file on our computer, or we can ask a server on the
    other side of the planet for information.
3.  Repeat tedious tasks. Have a few thousand emails to send? Need to
    spellcheck several thousand words? You can do these things with just
    a handful of code.
4.  Reuse useful code snippets. Rather than copy/paste the same lines of
    code in multiple places, we can assign a name to that code. This
    allows us to use it wherever we like by simply referring to its
    name.
5.  Decide what to do based on the current situation. When we write
    code, we often need to carry out one task under a specific set of
    circumstances, but another task if the circumstances differ. We can
    write code to decide which action to take.

Of course, in order to work, code needs to follow a specific set of
rules.
