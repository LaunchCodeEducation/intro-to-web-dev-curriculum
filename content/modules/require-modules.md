# Require Modules

::: index
! require
:::

In order to take advantage of modules, we must *import* them with the
**require** command. You have seen this before with `readline-sync`.

``` {.js linenos=""}
const input = require('readline-sync');

let name = input.question("What is your name?");
console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
```

Line 1 imports the `readline-sync` module and assigns its functions to
the `input` variable.

Modules are either *single functions* or *objects that contain multiple
functions*. If importing a module returns a single function, we use the
variable name to call that function. If the module returns an object, we
use dot notation to call the functions stored in the object. In line 3,
we see an example of this. `input.question` calls the `question`
function stored in the `readline-sync` module.

Later, we will see examples of importing and using single function
modules.

::: admonition
Example

Let\'s check the type of `input` after we import the `readline-sync`
module.

``` js
const input = require('readline-sync');

console.log(typeof input);
```

**Console Output**

    object
:::

The `readline-sync` module contains several key/value pairs, each of
which matches a key (e.g. `question`) with a specific function.

## Where Do We Find Modules?

Modules come from three places:

1.  A local file on your computer.
2.  Node itself, known as Core modules.
3.  An external registry such as NPM.

## How Does Node Know Where to Look?

The string value passed into `require` tells Node where to look for a
module.

### User Created Modules

If a module is stored on your computer, the string passed into `require`
must provide a *path* and a *filename*. This path tells Node where to
find the module, and it describes how to move up and down within the
folders on your computer. Paths can be extremely detailed, but best
practice recommends that you keep local modules either in the same
folder as your project or only one level from your project. Simple paths
are better!

A **relative path** starts with `./` or `../`.

1.  `./` tells Node, *Search for the module in the current project
    folder*.
2.  `../` tells Node, *Search for the module in the folder one level UP
    from the project*.

As an example, let\'s assume we have a folder structure like:

![](./figures/path-example.png)

Following best practice gives us three scenarios for importing one file
into another:

1.  **The module is in the same folder:** If we want to import
    `hello.js` into `index.js`, then we add
    `const hello = require('./hello.js');` on line 1 of `index.js`.
2.  **The module is one level up:** If we want to import `hello.js` into
    `myCoolApp.js`, then we add `const hello = require('../hello.js');`
    on line 1 of `myCoolApp.js`.
3.  **The module is one level down:** If we want to import
    `myCoolApp.js` into `index.js`, then we add
    `const coolApp = require('./Projects/myCoolApp.js');` on line 1 of
    `index.js`. This tells Node to search for `myCoolApp.js` in the
    `Projects` sub-folder, which is in the same folder as `index.js`.

### Other Modules

If the filename passed to `require` does NOT start with `./` or `../`,
then Node checks two resources for the module requested.

1.  Node looks for a Core module with a matching name.
2.  Node looks for a module installed from an external resource like
    NPM.

Core modules are installed in Node itself, and as such do not require a
path description. These modules are *local*, but Node knows where to
find them. Core modules take precedence over ANY other modules with the
same name.

Note

[W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_modules.asp) provides
a convenient list of the Core Node modules.
:::

If Node does not find the requested module after checking Core, it looks
to the [NPM registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/), which contains
hundreds of thousands of free code packages for developers.

In the next section, we will learn more about NPM and how to use it.

## Package.json File

Node keeps track of all the modules you import into your project. This
list of modules is stored inside a `package.json` file.

For example, if we only import `readline-sync`, the file looks something
like:

``` {.json linenos=""}
{
   "main": "index.js",
   "dependencies": {
      "readline-sync": "1.4.9"
   }
}
```

You may not have seen `package.json` yet, because repl.it hides this
file by default. We will talk more about this later.

Question

Assume you have the following file structure:

![](./figures/requireCC.png)

Which statement allows you to import the `rutabaga` module into
`project.js`?

a.  `const rutabaga = require('/rutabaga.js');`
b.  `const rutabaga = require('./rutabaga.js');`
c.  `const rutabaga = require('../rutabaga.js');`
d.  `const rutabaga = require('./Tubers/rutabaga.js');`
