In this chapter, we showed how to use `require` to pull a module into your
project, and we presented two ways to use `module.exports`. Of course, these
are not the only ways to share content.

A quick search online shows that besides functions, we can also share
individual variables. There are also alternative syntaxes for
`module.exports` - even one that exports as an object, but imports as a
function (which means no dot notation).

The skills you practiced in this chapter provide a solid foundation for
modules. Learning the alternatives becomes a matter of personal preference and
the requirements for your job.
