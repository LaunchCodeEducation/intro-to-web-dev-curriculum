# Logical Operators

::: index
operators
:::

Recall that an operator is one or more characters that carries out an
action on its operand(s). In `data-and-variables`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} we learned about three types of operators:

-   Arithmetic operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
-   The string operator `+`.
-   Compound assignment operators, such as `+=` and `-=`.

Arithmetic and string operators take number and string operands,
respectively, returning values of the same type. Compound assignment
operators work similarly with numbers or strings while also reassigning
the value of the first, variable operand.

## Boolean Operators

::: index
single: operator; comparison single: operator; boolean
:::

In addition to these operators, we learned about comparison operators
like `===`, `<`, and others. These operators are part of a larger class
known as **boolean operators**, so-called because they return a boolean
value (`true` or `false`).

Three additional boolean operators allow us to create more complex
expressions. These are described below.

### Logical AND

::: index
! &&
:::

::: index
single: operator; boolean single: boolean; expression, compound
:::

A **compound boolean expression** is a boolean expression built out of
smaller boolean expressions. JavaScript allows us to create a compound
boolean expression using the logical AND operator, `&&`.

The operator takes two operands, and the resulting expression is `true`
if *both* operands are `true` individually. If either operand is
`false`, the overall expression is `false`.

::: admonition
Example

In English, the `&&` operator mirrors the use of the word \"and\" (hence
the name \"logical AND\"). A sentence like \"Roses are red and violets
are blue,\" is true as a whole precisely because roses are actually red,
and violets are actually blue.

On the other hand, the sentence \"Roses are red and violets are green,\"
is false as a whole. While roses are indeed red, violets are not green.
:::

Let\'s see how this works in code.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
console.log(7 > 5 && 5 > 3);
console.log(7 > 5 && 2 > 3);
console.log(2 > 3 && 'dog' === 'cat');
```

**Console Output**

    true
    false
    false
:::

In line 1, `7 > 5 && 5 > 3` evaluates to `true` because both `7 > 5` and
`5 > 3` are `true` individually.

The expression `7 > 5 && 2 > 3` evaluates to `false` because one of the
two expressions, `2 > 3`, is `false`.

Like line 2, line 3 returns `false` because both sub-expressions are
`false`. Notice that we can mix and match data types however we like, as
long as both sides of the `&&` expression are themselves boolean
expressions.

### Logical OR

::: index
! \|\|
:::

::: index
single: operator; boolean
:::

JavaScript\'s logical OR operator, `||`, also creates compound boolean
expressions. This operator takes two operands, and the resulting
expression is `true` if *either* of the operands are `true`
individually. If both operands are `false`, the overall expression is
`false`.

::: admonition
Example

As with logical AND, logical OR mirrors our experience of English
language truth values. The sentence \"Pigs can fly or dogs can run,\" is
true as a whole. Joining the two clauses by \"or\" requires that only
one of them is true in order for the full sentence to be true.

When both of the clauses joined by \"or\" are false, the statement as a
whole is false. For example, \"Pigs can fly or dogs can speak Spanish,\"
is a false statement.
:::

Let\'s look at some examples in JavaScript.

``` {.js linenos=""}
console.log(7 > 5 || 5 > 3);
console.log(7 > 5 || 2 > 3);
console.log(2 > 3 || 'dog' === 'cat');
```

**Console Output**

    true
    true
    false

Lines 1 and 2 both return `true` because at least one of the comparison
expressions joined by `||` is `true`. Line 3 returns `false` because
both sub-expressions are `false`.

::: admonition
Warning

The single symbols `&` and `|` are themselves valid JavaScript
operators, so accidentally leaving off one symbols when typing `&&` or
`||` will not result in an error message.

The operators `&` and `|` are [bitwise
operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators),
which are beyond the scope of this course.

Most programmers rarely use `&` and `|`, and it is not important for you
to understand them at this point. However, you should *never* use them
in place of `&&` and `||`.

### Logical NOT

::: index
! !
:::

::: index
single: operator; boolean
:::

The logical NOT operator, `!`, takes only a single operand and reverses
its boolean value.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
console.log(! true);
console.log(! false);
```

**Console Output**

    false
    true
:::

The operator `!` (sometimes called \"bang\") has the same semantic role
as the word \"not\" in English.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
console.log( !(5 > 7) );
console.log( !('dog' === 'cat') );
```

**Console Output**

    true
    true
:::

## Operator Precedence

::: index
single: operator; precedence
:::

We now have a number of operators in our toolkit. It is important to
understand how these operators relate to each other with respect to
**operator precedence**. Operator precedence is the set of rules that
dictate in which order the operators are applied.

JavaScript will always apply the logical NOT operator, `!`, first. Next,
it applies the arithmetic operators, followed by the comparison
operators. The logical AND and OR are applied last.

This means that the expression `x * 5 >= 10 && y - 6 <= 20` will be
evaluated so as to first perform the arithmetic and then check the
relationships. The `&&` evaluation will be done last. The order of
evaluation is the same as if we were to use parentheses to group, as
follows:

``` js
((x * 5) >= 10) && ((y - 6) <= 20)
```

While parentheses are not always necessary due to default operator
precedence, they make expressions much more readable. As a best
practice, we encourage you to use them, especially for more complicated
expressions.

The following table lists operators in order of precedence, from highest
(applied first) to lowest (applied last). A complete table for the
entire language can be found in the [MDN JavaScript
Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table).

  Precedence   Category                      Operators
  ------------ ----------------------------- --------------------------
  (highest)    Logical NOT                   `!`
               Exponentiation                `**`
               Multiplication and division   `*`, `/`, `%`
               Addition and subtraction      `+`, `-`
               Comparison                    `<=`, `>=`, `>`, `<`
               Equality                      `===`, `!==`, `==`, `!=`
               Logical AND                   `&&`
  (lowest)     Logical OR                    `||`

## Truth Tables

::: index
! truth table
:::

**Truth tables** help us understand how logical operators work by
calculating all of the possible return values of a boolean expression.
Let\'s look at the truth table for `&&`, which assumes we have two
boolean expressions, A and B, joined by `&&`.

::: admonition
Example

  A         B         A `&&` B
  --------- --------- ----------
  `true`    `true`    `true`
  `true`    `false`   `false`
  `false`   `true`    `false`
  `false`   `false`   `false`

  : Truth Table for `&&`
:::

Consider the first row of the truth table. This row states that if A is
true and B is true, then A && B is true. This is a fact, regardless of
what boolean expressions A and B might actually be. The two middle rows
demonstrate that if either A or B is false, then A && B is false. (If
this idea is hard to grasp, try substituting actual expressions for A
and B.)
