# Studio: Goal Setting and Getting into the Right Mindset

::: index

During this studio, we will ask you to think about your mindset when it
comes to facing challenges. Do challenges deter you or delight you? If
challenges are something you delight in, you might have a growth
mindset.

A **growth mindset** can be powered by one word, "yet". The word "yet"
allows us to acknowledge that we don't know something AND that we are
capable of learning it. With "yet", the sentence "I don't understand
booleans" becomes "I don't understand booleans [yet]{.title-ref}."

Growth must occur over an entire career. As technology evolves, even the
most senior developers have to learn new skills. Creating a framework
for learning, which includes setting achievable goals, is important for
being a developer. Technology will change and adapt, and we should learn
to do the same!

When setting goals, those goals should be SMART. SMART stands for:

> **Specific**
>
> **Measurable**
>
> **Attainable**
>
> **Relevant**
>
> **Time Bound**

We will be discussing your goals for this class and your career. While
you don\'t have to do any prior goal setting or preparation to make the
most of this activity, please take the time to write down some goals
before class if it would make you more comfortable.
