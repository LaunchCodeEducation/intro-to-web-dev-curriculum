# Conditionals

::: index
! conditional
:::

At the beginning of this chapter, we decided that we wanted to be able
to write code that only executes when a given condition is `true`.

Again, here is our motivating example:

::: admonition
Example

Consider a banking application that can remind you when a bill is due.
The application will notify you that a bill is due soon, but *only if*
the bill has not already been paid.
:::

We summarized the condition as follows: Send a notification of an
upcoming bill if the statement \"the bill is unpaid\" is true.

In such a program, JavaScript uses booleans to represent the conditional
\"the bill is unpaid\". Based on the truth of this statement, the
program executes or skips the code for notifying the user.

The JavaScript construct that enables such behavior is a
**conditional**.

## `if` Statements

::: index
! if, code block
:::

The most basic form of a conditional is an **if statement**. Here\'s how
to create one in JavaScript:

![](figures/if.png){height="400px"}

Let\'s look at each component of this new syntax.

-   The `if` statement consists of a header line and a body. The header
    line begins with the keyword `if` followed by a boolean expression
    enclosed in parentheses.
-   `condition` is a boolean expression (an expression that evaluates to
    either `true` or `false`).
-   The statements that follow the condition, within `{ }`, make up a
    **code block**. The code within the brackets `{ }` will be executed
    if the condition evaluates to true. If the condition evaluates to
    false, the code within the brackets is ignored.

Here is an explicit example that mimics our banking program.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let billHasBeenPaid = false;

if (!billHasBeenPaid) {
   console.log("Your bill is due soon!");
}
```

**Console Output**

    Your bill is due soon!
:::

The message prints because `billHasBeenPaid` is `false`, so
`!billHasBeenPaid` evaluates to `true`. If we were to change the value
of `billHasBeenPaid` to be `true`, then `!billHasBeenPaid` would
evaluate to `false` and the code block would *not* execute.

The condition in an `if` statement can be any boolean expression, such
as `name === 'Jack'` or `points > 10` (here, `name` and `points` are
variables). Additionally, the code block associated with a conditional
can be of any size. This conditional has a code block with two lines of
code:

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
if (num % 2 === 0 && num > 3) {
   console.log(num, "is even");
   console.log(num, "is greater than 3");
}
```
:::

While not required, the code within a conditional code block is
typically indented to make it more readable. Similarly, it is a common
convention to place the opening `{` at the end of the first line, and
the closing `}` on a line of its own following the last line of the code
block.

You should follow such conventions, even though ignoring them will not
create an error. To see why, compare the readability of this example,
which is functionally equivalent to the one above.

``` {.js linenos=""}
if (num % 2 === 0 && num > 3)
{ console.log(num, "is even");
 console.log(num, "is greater than 3"); }
```

Aside from being more aesthetically pleasing, the first version also
makes it easier to visually identify the pair of matching curly
brackets, which helps prevent syntax errors.

::: admonition
Warning

If the code block associated with a conditional consists of only one
line, then the enclosing curly brackets can be omitted.

However, this is NOT a best-practice, as it makes the logic harder to
follow.

``` {.js linenos=""}
if (!billHasBeenPaid)
   console.log("Your bill is due soon!");
```

We will use curly brackets for ALL conditional code blocks, and
encourage you to do so as well, at least until you become comfortable
with reading and writing more complex JavaScript.
:::

## `else` Clauses

::: index
conditional, ! else, ! if-else, branching
:::

An **else clause** can be paired with an `if` statement to specify code
that should be executed when the condition is false.

![](figures/if-else.png){height="400px"}

We can use an `else` clause within our bank app to send a message if no
bills are currently due.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let billHasBeenPaid = true;

if (!billHasBeenPaid) {
   console.log("Your bill is due soon!");
} else {
   console.log("Your payments are up to date.");
}
```

**Console Output**

    Your payments are up to date.
:::

This structure is known as an **if-else statement**, and it provides a
mechanism for **branching**. The flow of the program can take one of two
paths when it reaches a conditional, depending on whether the condition
is `true` or `false`.

![](figures/conditional-flow.png){height="500px"}

## `else if` Statements

::: index
conditional, ! else if
:::

If-else statements allow us to construct two alternative paths. A single
condition determines which path will be followed. We can build more
complex conditionals using an `else if` clause. These allow us to add
additional conditions and code blocks, which facilitate more complex
branching.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let x = 10;
let y = 20;

if (x > y) {
   console.log("x is greater than y");
} else if (x < y) {
   console.log("x is less than y");
} else {
   console.log("x and y are equal");
}
```

**Console Output**

    x is less than y
:::

Let\'s summarize the flow of execution of this conditional:

1.  Line 4 begins the conditional. The boolean expression `x > y`
    evaluates to `false`, since 10 is not greater than 20. This causes
    line 5 to be skipped.
2.  Line 6 contains an else-if statement. The boolean expression `x < y`
    evaluates to `true`, since 10 is less than 20. This triggers the
    execution of line 7.
3.  The code block associated with the `else` clause on lines 8-10 is
    skipped, because one of the conditions above was true.

As with a simple `if` statement, the `else` clause is optional in this
context as well. The following example does not print anything, since
both conditions evaluate to false and there is no `else` clause.

``` {.js linenos=""}
let x = 10;
let y = 10;

if (x > y) {
    console.log("x is greater than y");
} else if (x < y) {
    console.log("x is less than y");
}
```

We can construct conditionals using `if`, `else if`, and `else` with a
lot of flexibility. The only rules are:

1.  We may not use `else` or `else if` without a preceding `if`
    statement.
2.  `else` and `else if` clauses are optional.
3.  Multiple `else if` statements may follow the `if` statement, but
    they must precede the `else` clause, if one is present.
4.  Only one `else` clause may be used.

Regardless of the complexity of a conditional, *no more than one* of the
code blocks will be executed.

::: admonition
Example

``` {.js linenos=""}
let x = 10;
let y = 20;

if (x > y) {
   console.log("x is greater than y");
} else if (x < y) {
   console.log("x is less than y");
} else if (x % 5 === 0) {
   console.log("x is divisible by 5");
} else if (x % 2 === 0) {
   console.log("x is even");
}
```

**Console Output**

    x is less than y
:::

Even though both of the conditions `x % 5 === 0` and `x % 2 === 0`
evaluate to `true`, neither of the associated code blocks is executed.
When a condition is satisfied, the rest of the conditional is skipped.

## Check Your Understanding

Question

What does the following code print?

``` {.js linenos=""}
let a = 7;
if (a % 2 === 1) {
   console.log("Launch");
} else if (a > 5) {
   console.log("Code");
} else {
   console.log("LaunchCode");
}
```

1.  `"Launch"`

2.  `"Code"`
