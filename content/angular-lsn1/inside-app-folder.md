# The Angular Framework

In VSCode, navigate to the `src` folder, open the `index.html` file, and
examine the code:

``` {.html linenos=""}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   <title>FirstProject</title>
   <base href="/">

   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
   <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>
   <app-root></app-root>
</body>
</html>
```

You have seen most of the HTML tags before, but line 12 shows something
odd. The strange tag `<app-root>` represents a key idea behind building
templates. Angular allows us to define our own tags, which are used as
another type of placeholder in an HTML file. In this case,
`<app-root></app-root>` reserves space on the web page for information
supplied by other files. Line 12 essentially says, \"Display all the
content from the `app` folder here.\"

As we add more pieces to our template, we will define specific tags to
help us arrange the different items on the screen. This makes it easier
for us to keep track of our content. For example, if we want to build a
web page that contains a shopping list, a movies to watch list, and
family photos, we can define the tags `<movies>`, `<grocery-list>`, and
`<family-photos>`. With these tags, we can reference specific content
whenever we want and clearly place it on a page. The tags also make it
easy to play with new styles and formats for our grocery list without
changing much code or altering the appearance of the movie list or
photos.

Most of our work with Angular will take place within the `app` folder,
so let\'s take a closer look at some of the files there.

## Inside the `app` folder

One way to change the color of the *Welcome to\...* heading would be to
open the `app.component.css` file and add some styling:

``` {.CSS linenos=""}
h1 {
   color: brown;
}
```

We can freely modify this file, but the CSS instructions only affect the
HTML files within `app`. Also, the code in `app.component.css` overrides
any CSS found in the higher level `styles.css` file.

This is the pattern for Angular. CSS instructions further down in the
file tree have higher priority. If `app` contained a subfolder with its
own `.css` file, then those instructions would be applied to the HTML
files within that subfolder.

Let\'s examine the code contained in three other `app` files.

### `app.component.html` File

::: admonition
Example

Here is a sample of the default code inside `app.component.html`:

``` {.html linenos=""}
<div style="text-align:center">
   <h1>
      Welcome to {{ title }}!
   </h1>
   <img width="300" alt="Angular Logo" src="image path...">
</div>
<h2>Here are some links to help you start: </h2>
<ul>
   <!-- List items here... -->
</ul>
```
:::

`app.component.html` contains the structure and most of the text seen on
the \"Welcome to\...\" page. Note the placeholder `{{title}}` in line 3.
This gets filled with data passed in from another file, and it allows us
to modify the content on the page without revising the HTML.

`app.component.html` serves as the main template for your web page. This
file will usually NOT hold a lot of HTML code. Instead, it will contain
many placeholders for content defined elsewhere in the project.

Later in this chapter, you will learn how to add new components to the
`app` folder as well as how to arrange them in the HTML file.

### `app.component.ts` File

::: admonition
Example

`app.component.ts`

``` {.TypeScript linenos=""}
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
   selector: 'app-root',
   templateUrl: './app.component.html',
   styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
   title = 'my-project-name';
}
```
:::

`app.component.ts` performs several important functions with very few
lines.

1.  Line 4 defines the tag `<app-root>`, which we saw in line 12 of
    `index.html`. The tag can also be used in any files that import the
    `AppComponent` class.
2.  Line 5 imports `app.component.html`, which we examined above.
3.  Line 6 imports `app.component.css`, which applies styling to the
    HTML file. (If you set a different color for the *Welcome to\...*
    sentence in the Try It tasks, this is why changing the css file
    worked).
4.  Line 8 makes the `AppComponent` class available to other files.

Take a look at `app.component.html` again. We mentioned the `{{title}}`
placeholder earlier and said that it gets filled with data from a
different file. Line 9 in `app.component.ts` supplies this data by
assigning the string `'my-project-name'` to the `title` variable.
Changing `'my-project-name'` to a different value alters the web page.

### `app.module.ts` File

::: admonition
Example

`app.module.ts`

``` {.TypeScript linenos=""}
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
   declarations: [ AppComponent ],
   imports: [ BrowserModule ],
   providers: [],
   bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
:::

Just like before, there is a lot going on within very few lines.

1.  Lines 1, 2, and 8 import and assign the core modules that make
    Angular work. This is part of the automatic process, so do not play
    with these (yet).
2.  Line 4 imports the class `AppComponent` from the local file
    `app.component.ts`.
3.  Line 4 also pulls in references to any other files linked to
    `app.component.ts`.
4.  Line 7 declares the imported local files as necessary for the
    project.
5.  Line 12 exports the `AppModule` class and makes it available to
    other files.

`app.module.ts` does the main work of pulling in the core libraries and
local files. As new parts are added to a project, the import statements,
`imports` array, and `declarations` array update automatically. We do
not have to worry about the details for adding this critical code
ourselves.

## Change The Content

Enough detail. Let\'s explore some more.

If you did not complete all of the
`Try It <try-it-Angular-intro>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} tasks on
the previous page, attempt them now. After that\...

### Try It!

1.  Run `ng serve` in the terminal to launch your web page again.

2.  In `app.component.ts`, declare and assign two variables in the
    `AppComponent` class\-\--`name` and `itemList`.

    a.  `name` holds your name.
    b.  `itemList` is an array holding at least 4 items.

    ``` {.TypeScript linenos=""}
    export class AppComponent {
       name: string = 'Barbara Liskov';
       itemList: string[] = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4'];
    }
    ```

    ::: admonition
    Note

    Instead of using the strong TypeScript variable declarations in step
    2, we could substitute a pattern more like JavaScript:

    ``` {.JavaScript linenos=""}
    export class AppComponent {
       name = 'Brendan Eich';
       itemList = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4'];
    }
    ```
    :::

3.  Replace line 4 in `app.component.html` with
    `<h1>{{name}}'s First Angular Project</h1>`. Save your work and then
    check to make sure the web page shows the new heading.

4.  Modify the `<li></li>` elements in `app.component.html` to display
    the elements from `itemList` in an unordered list. Be sure to use
    placeholders like `{{itemList[0]}}` between the tags.

5.  Return to the `AppComponent` class in the `.ts` file. Define a
    `rectangle` object that has keys of `length`, `width` and `area`.
    Assign numbers to `length` and `width`, and have `area` be a
    function that calculates and returns the area.

    ``` {.TypeScript linenos=""}
    rectangle = {
       length: 5,
       width: 6,
       area: function() {
          return this.length * this.width;
       }
    }
    ```

6.  Add a `<p></p>` element in `app.component.html` to display the
    sentence, \"The rectangle has a length of \_\_\_ cm, a width of
    \_\_\_ cm, and an area of \_\_\_ cm\^2.\" Replace the blanks with
    placeholders so the web page displays the correct numbers whenever
    `length` or `width` are changed.

    ``` html
    <p>The rectangle has a length of {{rectangle.length}} cm, a width of {{rectangle.width}} cm,
       and an area of {{rectangle.area()}} cm^2.</p>
    ```

## Filename Pattern

Each of the files in the `app` folder contain the word `component` in
their name. This results from the fundamental idea behind Angular. Each
*template* for a web page is constructed from smaller pieces, and these
pieces are the *components*.

Our next step is to take a closer look at these building blocks within a
template.
